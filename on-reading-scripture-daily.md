Most days, I open Scripture with intention.

Not because I always feel especially disciplined or focused, but because I’ve learned, sometimes the hard way, that I need to stay near God’s voice if I want to navigate life with clarity, humility, and hope.

My daily reading usually begins where I left off the last time I opened the Bible. There isn’t a stopwatch running, and there isn’t a checklist waiting at the end. I read until something slows me down. Sometimes that’s thirty minutes. Sometimes it’s much longer. Occasionally, it’s a single verse that refuses to let go.

When something stands out, my instinct is to pause and ask a simple question: *What does this mean for me practically?*  
Sometimes the answer is clear. Other times it isn’t. Either way, that question tends to follow me through the day, into work, conversations, decisions, and prayer.

There are also times when I set aside wherever I am in my reading to follow the church sermon text, especially when I sense God drawing my attention there. And when I’m seeking wisdom, direction, or understanding in a specific area of life, I’ll often find myself tracing a question or theme through Scripture rather than continuing straight through a book.

Deeper study tends to happen weekly. That’s usually when I slow way down, digging into context, language, and how different parts of Scripture hold together. Sometimes that turns into hours. Other times it turns into quiet meditation that stretches beyond the page and into the rhythm of the day.

Part of this posture is simple obedience.

Scripture doesn’t just invite us to read, it calls us to *study*. Paul’s exhortation to Timothy has always mattered to me: *“Study to shew thyself approved unto God… rightly dividing the word of truth.”* Not as a formula for being “better,” but as a reminder that faith isn’t careless, shallow, or passive. Listening well to God means handling His Word with care, attention, and humility.

When my posture is healthy, reading Scripture feels grounding, convicting, clarifying, and hopeful. When it’s off, I can feel it pretty quickly. Rushing creeps in. Reading starts to feel like a task to check off rather than a place to listen.

For me, reading Scripture is mostly about hearing the voice of God and learning how to do life in every area of life, not checking off a task, and not learning how to argue.

I don’t follow a formal reading plan, though I do see the value in them, especially for those who are unsure where to start, what to read next, or who are simply trying to build discipline around daily reading. One resource I appreciate conceptually is the set of daily reading plans provided by the Legacy Standard Bible. I’m drawn to the clarity and precision of the translation, and for some, a structured path through Scripture can be a helpful guide.

If you’re looking for something like that, you can find those plans here:

This isn’t a formula, and it isn’t a benchmark. We’re all works in progress. What matters most isn’t keeping pace, it’s staying attentive, open, and willing to be shaped.

There is growth.  
There is grace.  
And there is always hope.

…just a thought.
