<p>Hi, I’m Jeff</p>

<p>I’m a husband, father, and grandfather, grateful for grace, still learning daily. By trade, I’m a technology consultant in the architecture and construction industry, but my heart beats for something deeper: faith, family, purpose, and the kind of reflection that doesn’t always make it into busy schedules.</p>

<p><em>Just A Thought</em> started as a way to slow down and listen, to the Word, to the moment, to what God might be whispering beneath the noise. It’s not a platform or a pulpit. It’s a practice. A space to process, question, wrestle, and grow. Most posts begin as something stirring in my own life, an insight during devotions, a conversation that lingers, a memory that won’t let go.</p>

<p>My wife and I host a Marrieds Small Group through our church, and we’ve been walking with couples for years, encouraging biblical marriage not by perfection, but by presence and perseverance. You’ll hear that heartbeat in many of my reflections.</p>

<p>On weekends, we hitch up our travel trailer and head outdoors to reset. Camping has become one of the ways we reconnect with each other, with nature, and with God. It started in our backyard, but now it takes us all across Southern California and beyond. I’m also a hunter, not just for game, but for sustenance, stillness, silence, and the clarity that tends to show up when distractions fade.</p>

<p>You’ll find a mix of reflections here: on faith, marriage, culture, technology, and the honest tensions of walking it all out. Some posts are rooted in Scripture, others in real-life lessons. Many wrestle with complexity, but all of them aim for clarity, not answers for everything, but a moment to think deeply and invite others to do the same.</p>

<p>I don’t pretend to have it all figured out. But I believe there’s value in pausing to ask, “What is God showing me here?”</p>

<p>So welcome. Pull up a chair, scroll a while, or just read one post and take it with you into your day.</p>

<p class="mb-5">It’s not always polished, but it’s always honest. And sometimes, that’s enough.<br><em>Thanks for reading—<br>Just a thought.</em></p>
