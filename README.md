# Just a Thought Blog 
by Jeff Thomas III

Welcome to *Just a Thought*, a personal blog where I reflect on faith, culture, biblical marriage, leadership, and the joys of camping. It’s a space for processing life through Scripture, story, and sincere thought. Every post ends with the same gentle invitation: *...just a thought.*


## ✍️ Topics I Write About

- Faith & Scripture reflections
- Biblical marriage and relationships
- Leadership, technology, and culture
- Personal growth and identity
- RV camping & slowing down with nature


## ⚙️ How the Blog is Set Up

This blog is powered by **Jekyll** and hosted with **GitHub Pages**, using a customized version of the [Clean Blog](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) theme.
