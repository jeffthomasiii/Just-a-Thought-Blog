### Every Story Needs a Third Voice  
Every marriage tells a story.  
There’s the story of *you*; your hopes, your wounds, your way of seeing the world.  
There’s the story of *him*; his dreams, his strengths, his silent battles.  
And then there’s the story of *us*; two lives trying to weave themselves into one.  

But here’s the tension: when only two voices are at the table, whose story wins? Which one matters more? Left to ourselves, we measure and compete. Your needs against his needs. Your perspective against hers. Even our “together” story can start to sound like a tug-of-war.  
> #### *Which one wins?*

That’s why every covenant needs a third voice, the voice of the One who designed it all. His word steadies what would otherwise fray. His order brings clarity when our stories collide. With Him at the center, the question shifts from *who wins* to *how do we walk together under His design?*  


### The First Word Belongs to Him  
Every couple enters marriage with their own script.  
You bring your family’s traditions, your way of handling money, your picture of what a “good marriage” looks like.  
He brings his habits, his history, his expectations.  

The tension comes when those scripts don’t match. Whose way is right? Whose family did it better? Which story becomes the blueprint? Without a higher standard, the strongest personality or the deepest pattern usually sets the tone, and that can leave the other diminished or resentful.  

But God spoke the first word about marriage. *“A man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh”* (Genesis 2:24). His word isn’t commentary, it’s the foundation. He is the Author, and only His design can hold the weight of two lives becoming one.  

When we return to His word, the debate shifts. It’s no longer about my script or his script, but *God’s script*. His first word becomes the guiding word, the one that makes “one flesh” possible.  


### When Love Forgets Its Maker  
The world tells us love can be anything, affection, loyalty, attraction, even convenience.  
The tension is this: when storms come, these versions of love often crack. They falter under pressure because they depend on feelings or circumstances.  

But Scripture reminds us: *“God is love”* (1 John 4:8). He is the Source. Without Him, what we call “love” is conditional. It says, *I’ll give as long as you give. I’ll stay as long as I’m fulfilled.* That isn’t love, it’s a bargain.  

True love, the kind that bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things (1 Corinthians 13:7), comes only from God. It’s His character shared with us. Without Him, we’re left grasping for a shadow. With Him, we find the substance that sustains a covenant through seasons of joy and seasons of trial alike.  


### The Mystery We Carry  
To the watching world, marriage looks like a social contract, a partnership of convenience, maybe even just a legal arrangement.  
The tension is that if this is all marriage is, then it has no greater meaning, it rises and falls on what we can get out of it.  

But Paul writes: *“This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church”* (Ephesians 5:32). Marriage is more than companionship. It is a living parable of God’s covenant love.  

Without God, the picture collapses. With Him, the mystery comes alive. Our marriages preach, whether we intend them to or not. They can preach self-interest, silence, or separation. Or, when centered on Him, they can preach the gospel of grace: Christ who loves, serves, and never forsakes His bride.  

This is why I’ve said before that *[marriage is ministry](https://jeffthomasiii.github.io/Just-a-Thought-Blog/marriage/faith/2025/07/01/marriage-is-ministry.html)*, because every covenant, lived God’s way, becomes a sermon without words, pointing back to the love of Christ.  


### The Braid That Does Not Break  
Two people can be fiercely loyal, deeply committed, even stubbornly determined to stay together. And yet, the tension is that life is heavier than human strength. Illness, financial strain, betrayal, loss, these things fray even the tightest bonds.  

But *“a cord of three strands is not quickly broken”* (Ecclesiastes 4:12). When God is woven into the union, He becomes the strength between you. Not just holding you together, but holding you up.  

His order teaches us sacrifice when we’d rather demand. His Spirit nudges us to forgive when we’d rather keep score. His presence gives peace when everything else feels unstable. Alone, we bend and break. With Him, we stand.  


### You, Him, and I  
Marriage was never meant to be a duet, it was always meant to be a trio. Your voice, her voice, and above all, His voice.  

The tension of marriage, whose way, whose needs, whose love, is resolved only when we let the Author define the story. In His design, we find not just survival, but the flourishing He intended from the beginning.  

Because at the heart of it, marriage isn’t just about two people learning to love each other. It’s about two people learning to reflect the love of Christ. And that story can only be written with Him at the center.

…just a thought.
