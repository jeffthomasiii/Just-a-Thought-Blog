### Rise and Grind… Until You Can’t  
“Rise and grind.”  
“Sleep when you’re dead.”  
“Keep hustling.”  

The slogans of hustle culture sound motivational, but underneath them often lurks exhaustion, discontent, and misplaced priorities.  


### Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Hustle  
Proverbs 23:4 speaks directly to this:  
*“Do not wear yourself out to get rich; have the wisdom to show restraint.”*  

It’s not wealth itself that Scripture condemns, provision and stewardship are good. The issue is the *wearing yourself out* in pursuit of it, the endless striving that promises satisfaction but rarely delivers.  

I’ve seen it in friends, coworkers, and even in myself: the temptation to equate value with productivity, or identity with income. But the wisdom of God calls us to step back, breathe, and remember that success is not the same as surrendering our lives on the altar of endless achievement.  


### The Lie of Limitless Grind  
Hustle culture sells the lie that more is always better, more hours, more clients, more dollars. But Proverbs reminds us that restraint is wisdom. Rest is not laziness; it’s alignment with God’s design.  

Jesus Himself modeled this. He often withdrew to quiet places (Luke 5:16). He didn’t heal every sick person or preach in every town. He embraced limits, trusting the Father’s timing.  

In contrast, hustle culture insists on limitless grind. It whispers that we’re falling behind if we’re not always doing.  

Scroll through social media and it’s easy to find influencers boasting about 4 a.m. wakeups, 16-hour days, and grinding without breaks. It’s framed as inspiration, but the comments are often filled with people confessing burnout or anxiety. The pursuit of wealth is celebrated, even as it quietly wears people down.  

But what do we lose in the process? Relationships. Joy. Health. Time with God.  

Redefining success means recognizing that wealth without wisdom is emptiness. True success is hearing, *“Well done, good and faithful servant”* (Matthew 25:23), not *“Well done, you worked yourself to death.”*  


### Enough Really Can Be Enough  
Proverbs 23:4 is not anti-work. It’s a reminder to resist anti-wisdom. Work is good, but wisdom calls us to balance. To pause. To rest. To know when enough is enough.  

So maybe today, success looks less like chasing the next dollar and more like putting the phone down, sitting with family, or spending time in prayer. Maybe it’s choosing restraint, trusting that God provides more than hustle ever could.  

…just a thought.  

Where in your life do you feel the pull of hustle culture most strongly, and what would wisdom and restraint look like there?
