Our first camping trip wasn’t to a national park or even a state campground. It was in our own backyard. We didn’t check the weather app. We didn’t really make a packing list. Truthfully, we didn’t know what we didn’t know. We just dragged out a tent, talked way too long about what we’d eat, and gave it a shot. The luxury of being steps from our kitchen made the menu the biggest decision we worried about. Everything else? We figured we’d learn as we went.  

That backyard campout was our “training wheels.” It was clumsy, simple, and more novelty than necessity, but it gave us a taste of adventure without the pressure of getting everything right.  

When we finally took our first real camping trip, we tagged along with some of my wife’s colleagues at Sun Outdoors San Diego Bay. If our backyard was training wheels, this was more like a luxury test drive. Resort-style pool, on-site restaurant, a camp store, planned activities, even mail delivery. It felt more like a hotel with hookups than the wild outdoors. Fun? Absolutely. But it set some unrealistic expectations about what most campgrounds would be like, especially when it came to cost and amenities. Not every site comes with a lazy river and weekend events.  

But here’s the part that made it even more intimidating: neither of us had ever towed anything before, let alone a 5,000-pound trailer. Just a week earlier we’d picked it up from the RV dealer, signed the paperwork, and driven away with the mix of excitement and terror that comes from making a big purchase you’re not yet sure you know how to handle. Now, with safety on the line, the financial weight of the trailer behind us, and the fear of looking foolish in front of more experienced campers, the pressure was real.  


### Stepping Into the Unknown  

That first trip with the trailer was more than a test of gear, it was a test of nerves. What if we misjudged a turn? What if we couldn’t back into a site? What if we regretted the whole thing?  

But stepping into the unknown is part of adventure. Risk isn’t about being reckless, it’s about being willing to look past your fear long enough to take the next step. And as we discovered, once you do, the road opens up in ways you couldn’t see from the driveway.  


### Lessons in the Middle  

Every trip added a layer of growth. We learned what to pack (and what not to overpack). We figured out how to tow with confidence, set up camp faster, and laugh more often when things didn’t go as planned.  

Growth also meant adjusting our expectations. The backyard had been too easy. Sun Outdoors had been too polished. The in-between, the campgrounds without pools or restaurants, became the place where we grew the most.  


### Fireside Conversations  

At the heart of it all, camping pulled us closer. No screens. No schedules. Just time. When you’re sitting by a fire under a canopy of stars, conversation slows down, walls come down, and connection deepens.  

We learned that camping wasn’t just about where we parked the trailer or how nice the amenities were, it was about creating margin in life to be together.  


### Where We Are Now  

These days, camping looks different. We tow with confidence. We’ve learned how to set up camp without stress, cook meals that actually work outdoors, and even pack lighter (though there’s always one or two things we forget). We camp monthly now, sometimes close to home, sometimes on longer backroad stretches, and each trip adds another story to our journey.  

It isn’t about luxury resorts or backyard convenience anymore. It’s about finding the right balance: enough comfort to enjoy the trip, enough challenge to keep the adventure alive, and enough space to slow down and connect.  

Looking back, it wasn’t really about the tent or the resort-style pool or even the miles traveled. It was about saying yes to adventure together, one small risk at a time. And each step built on the last, carrying us from the safety of the backyard to the wide-open backroads.  

Adventure doesn’t always begin with a big leap. Sometimes it begins with a backyard trial run. The important part is to start—because on the other side of risk and growth is deeper relationship, richer memories, and a story worth telling.  

…just a thought.
