excerpt: "Holiness isn’t about being flawless, it’s about being set apart. This post wrestles with Peter’s call to be holy and explores what it means practically, with real-life reflections and relatable stories."

> “As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’” 1 Peter 1:14–16 (ESV)


## Holiness and the Questions We’d Rather Avoid

Let’s be honest: the word *“holy”* feels heavy.

For some, it conjures up images of stained-glass saints or people who never mess up and never miss a 5:00 a.m. prayer meeting. For others, it sounds like a distant standard, noble, sure, but definitely out of reach.

Then Peter comes along and drops a three-verse bomb that doesn’t let us off the hook. He doesn’t ask us to *admire* God’s holiness, he calls us to *mirror* it. In all our conduct.

And that raises the question I’ve been quietly wrestling with:

> **What does it mean practically to be holy?**

This post won’t answer that fully. But maybe that’s okay. Maybe holiness begins not with answers, but with better questions, and the courage to let the Spirit teach us as we walk it out.


### Identity Before Behavior

> **“As obedient children…”** – 1 Peter 1:14

There’s a story of a young boy who got into trouble during recess. He’d pushed another student in frustration, and a teacher caught the tail end of the scuffle. As the staff brought him inside, the boy’s face crumpled, not from fear of punishment, but from the weight of something deeper.

The principal knelt to speak with him gently. “Why’d you do it?” “I don’t know,” the boy mumbled. “He was just being mean.”

After a pause, the principal said, “That’s not how your parents raised you, is it?” The boy shook his head. “Do you remember what your mom always says about who you are?” Tears welled up in the boy’s eyes. “She says I’m kind. That I’m a peacemaker.” “And do you believe her?” A pause. Then a quiet nod.


Peter begins not with behavior but identity: **“As obedient children…”**Not rule-followers. Not perfectionists. **Children.**

Holiness doesn’t begin with striving, it begins with **belonging**. God isn’t demanding you prove something. He’s reminding you:

> *“You’re mine. Live like it.”*

**🪞 Reflection:**
- Am I living like someone who belongs to Him?
- Where might I be forgetting who I am?


### Don’t Go Back

> **“…do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance.”** – 1 Peter 1:14

It always starts the same way. You’re running a few minutes behind, the playlist is just getting good, and you're cruising down the freeway when, bam! Someone cuts you off with zero warning and no blinker. You slam the brakes, mutter something unholy under your breath, and that *old version of you* suddenly takes the wheel… figuratively and emotionally.

What’s worse is that for a brief moment, it feels justified. As if you’ve been deputized by the Department of Motor Vehicle Vengeance.

But then, something inside nudges you. A quiet question: *“Is this really who you are now?”*


Peter isn’t just warning us about external sin, he’s reminding us not to slide back into the **reflexes** of our old life.

Holiness means recognizing when something doesn’t fit anymore, like a favorite shirt you’ve outgrown. When the Spirit convicts us, it’s not shame, it’s a whisper:

> *“You’re not that person anymore.”*

**🪞 Reflection:**
- What habits, reactions, or attitudes still try to pull me back?
- Where is God inviting me to pause and respond differently?


### Imitation

> **“…be holy in all your conduct.”** – 1 Peter 1:15

He was five years old, standing barefoot in the middle of the living room, one hand on his hip and the other waving a plastic spoon like it was a microphone. He was “preaching,” sort of. Mimicking the pastor he’d seen at church. But his tiny voice didn’t boom, it squeaked. Every now and then, he’d glance at his dad for approval.

A few minutes later, he dragged a blanket over his shoulders like a suit jacket and climbed up on the couch. “Now listen,” he said in his best grown-up voice, “we have to forgive because that’s what Jesus did on the cross, okay?”

His dad didn’t correct him. He just watched quietly… humbled.


Children imitate what they admire. And whether we realize it or not, we do the same.

Holiness isn’t just avoiding sin, it’s **imitating the character of God**.It’s grace in our tone. Purity in our motives. Faithfulness in our commitments. Mercy in our reactions.

The more we watch Jesus, the more we start sounding like Him, even without trying.

**🪞 Reflection:**
- Who or what is shaping my conduct most right now?
- What would change if I simply started imitating Jesus?


### Tension of Being Set Apart

> **“You shall be holy, for I am holy.”** – 1 Peter 1:16

The job offer was nearly perfect. Great pay, generous bonus structure, flexibility, and a fast track to a senior role. But something in the fine print didn't sit right.

It wasn’t illegal. It wasn’t immoral. But it *was* manipulative, an unspoken culture of cutting corners, exaggerating promises to clients, and sacrificing people to hit numbers. The recruiter called it "strategic positioning.” The applicant called it… a red flag.

After days of wrestling and prayer, they walked away.

The recruiter was baffled. “You know how rare it is to even get this kind of offer, right?” They nodded. They knew. But they also knew who they were becoming.


Sometimes holiness means walking away from something that looks *too good to pass up*, simply because your soul knows better.

Holiness won’t always make you popular. It won’t always be understood. But it will **form your character** and align your life with the God who called you to be different.

**🪞 Reflection:**
- Where in my life is God inviting me to be courageously different?
- What have I been afraid to let go of because it might set me apart?


### Maybe the Question *Is* the Point

So... what does it *really* mean to be holy?

I don’t have a perfect answer. But maybe holiness starts with asking the question sincerely, and letting the Spirit shape the answer in us day by day.

We’ll trip up. We’ll snap back at traffic. We’ll hesitate when it costs something.

But we’ll also grow. We’ll pause. We’ll forgive. We’ll reflect Him.

> Holiness is less about polishing up our behavior
> and more about living like we actually belong to Him.

*Just a thought.*
