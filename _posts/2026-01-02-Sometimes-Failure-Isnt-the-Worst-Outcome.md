There are few things more disorienting than wanting something deeply, praying for it earnestly, and watching it fall apart anyway. We call that failure. We replay it. We wonder what we did wrong. And in a culture that celebrates winning, hustle, and “making it,” failure can start to feel like a verdict on our effort, our faith, or our worth.

I recently heard **[Ruslan KD](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj2yZE96gWsFyeVYnY9zXeg)** say something that stopped me in my tracks: *“Sometimes failure isn’t the worst outcome. It could be success at the wrong thing.”*

That line reframes the conversation.

We are trained to fear failure, to avoid it at all costs. Yet Scripture rarely treats failure as the ultimate threat. More often, it appears as part of the slow work of preparation, growth, and learning. What God seems far more concerned with is formation, who we are becoming, rather than the speed or visibility of what we achieve.

Failure has a way of slowing us down. It exposes weak foundations. It humbles ambition. It forces reflection. It creates space where dependence on God can actually take root. None of that feels good in the moment, but very little that forms us deeply ever does.

Success, on the other hand, can be deceptively dangerous, especially when it arrives early or validates something God has not finished shaping yet. Success at the wrong thing can lock us into paths that look right on the outside but quietly erode peace, clarity, or character. It can give us momentum without maturity and opportunity without readiness.

That is where discernment matters more than desire.

Wanting something badly does not automatically make it God’s will. Praying sincerely does not guarantee alignment with His timing or purpose. Desire is real, and often good, but it is not the same as discernment. When unchecked, desire can blur wisdom, turning persistence into pressure and faith into fixation.

Which raises one of the harder questions we face as believers: *How do you know when a door is closed by God, and when it is a moment that calls for prayerful persistence?*

As far as I can tell, Scripture does not give us a clean formula, but experience often reveals a pattern. Doors God closes tend to come with resistance that remains even after prayer, wise counsel, and honest self-examination. Peace does not grow with time. The cost to integrity or spiritual health outweighs the fruit. By contrast, doors God calls us to walk through, even difficult ones, are often marked by a quiet steadiness. Opposition is paired with peace, refinement without confusion, and growth without compromise.

Persistence, after all, is not about forcing outcomes. It is about obedience without obsession.

Sometimes God’s answer is not “not yet,” but “not this.” And that can feel like loss, even when it is not. What if it is protection instead? What if the door closed not because you were incapable, but because succeeding there would have formed you in ways God never intended?

Scripture reminds us that *“the heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps”* (Proverbs 16:9). That does not dismiss our effort or desire. It reorders our trust.

We do not encounter failure because God has abandoned us. Sometimes what we label as failure is actually God redirecting us, guarding us, and continuing His work of maturity in us. In Christ, nothing is wasted. What looks like a setback can become instruction, refinement, and growth.

Failure may bruise the ego, but misaligned success can distort the soul. Learning to trust a closed door is not about giving up. It is about believing that God’s no can be just as intentional as His yes.

…just a thought.
