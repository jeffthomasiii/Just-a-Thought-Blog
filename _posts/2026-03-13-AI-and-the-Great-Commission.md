**"If we can use AI to reach the unreached, what's stopping us?"**

The same technology that answers your email in seconds can also translate the Gospel into dozens of languages. It can generate Bible study plans for remote villages. It can train underground pastors using simulations and sermons tailored to their context. It can even whisper truth in digital places where missionaries can't go. Imagine an AI-powered audio Bible streaming into an isolated home in a country closed to the Gospel, or a seeker in a remote region talking to a chatbot that gently leads them to the words of Jesus.

No, AI is not the Gospel. But it can carry it.

When Jesus gave the Great Commission, He didn’t mention platforms, algorithms, or tools. He simply said, “Go.” And for centuries, the Church has gone. With letters and feet, with ships and radios, with planes and print and broadcast.

Now we have something new.

The tools have changed, but the mission hasn’t.

AI is opening new frontiers for the Gospel. Through translation, it can accelerate access to Scripture for languages still waiting for a Bible. Through cultural adaptation, it can adjust tone and delivery so the message lands in a way that resonates without compromising truth. In resource-limited countries, AI can generate training outlines, devotionals, and leadership content for pastors and teachers. Through digital evangelism, chatbots and search responses can help people wrestling with faith questions find biblical answers. A teenager searching “what happens when I die” might not click a sermon, but they might engage with a Spirit-guided AI response that points them to eternal truth.

These are not hypotheticals. They are already happening.

Of course, AI is not perfect. Neither was the printing press, or the radio, or even broadcast television. Every tool we’ve used for good has also been used for harm. But the answer isn’t to avoid it entirely. It’s to use it wisely. To pair innovation with conviction. To let AI amplify the Church’s reach, not replace her presence.

AI can support missionaries. It can amplify the voices of evangelists. It can equip the local church and embolden the global one. But it cannot replace obedience. Or incarnation. Or love.

If the Church is the body of Christ, then technology is not its voice. It’s the microphone. And microphones don’t speak on their own. They carry what we choose to say.

So the question isn’t whether AI will take over the mission. It’s whether we will use it to finish what Jesus started.

Because the call to go still stands. The tools are just faster now.

So let’s use them.

Just a thought.
