The mission hasn’t changed.

Jesus still calls us to go and make disciples. To teach, to baptize, to love, and to obey. That calling remains whether we’re speaking from a pulpit or typing from a laptop.

> "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations..."  
> —Matthew 28:19–20 ESV

But the tools have changed. And they keep changing.

From handwritten scrolls to the printing press. From radio sermons to YouTube devotionals. From personal letters to AI-generated email sequences. We’re not the first generation to wrestle with new technology. But we are the first to face something that can mimic human understanding without possessing it.

That demands a sober kind of creativity.

AI can help us translate. It can generate content in multiple languages, optimize readability, and personalize digital discipleship paths. It can help you build tools, apps, slides, sermons, and follow-up resources that once took hours—or teams—to create.

But it cannot obey. It cannot go. It cannot love.

Only people do that.

The gospel is not a data set to be optimized. It’s a message to be embodied. It requires sacrifice, presence, and relationship. It calls us not just to distribute information, but to *make disciples*, a deeply relational, Spirit-led, long-haul work.

Technology may open new doors, but we still have to walk through them. With humility. With prayer. With love.

So yes, use AI. Use it well. Just don’t let it do what Jesus asked *you* to do.

Just a thought.
