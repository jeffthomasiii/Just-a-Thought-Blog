If you’ve ever let a garden go untended, even for a few weeks, you know what happens. The weeds don’t ask for permission. They just show up. Grow fast. And take over.

Marriage is no different.  
God plants something beautiful between a husband and wife. But it doesn't flourish by accident. It takes watering, pruning, sun—and yes, **weeding**.

What are the weeds?  They're the assumptions we don’t clarify.  The offenses we let fester.  The thoughts we entertain that whisper, *"Maybe we’re just too different…"*

Scripture warns us to take “every thought captive” (2 Corinthians 10:5). Why? Because thoughts become beliefs. And unchecked beliefs become barriers.

It’s not always the big, obvious sins that destroy a marriage.  More often, it’s the subtle things we let slide:

- That silent resentment.  
- That internal comparison.  
- That sarcastic tone we stop correcting.

These are the weeds. And they don’t disappear on their own.  We must pull them, daily, intentionally, prayerfully.

But some weeds don’t start inside the garden, they’re blown in from outside.  Words from well-meaning friends who say, *“You’re doing too much,”* or *“Maybe you’ve outgrown each other.”*  Cultural voices that normalize growing apart or advise, *“You deserve better.”*  Even subtle criticisms of your spouse from people who don’t carry the weight of your covenant.  My old pastor called them *irritants*, small things that disrupt unity, loyalty, or love.  If you don’t guard the gates of your garden, these seeds take root before you realize they’ve landed.

And we must do it together.  A garden isn’t maintained by one hand alone. It’s a shared work. What’s growing in the garden of your marriage?  When was the last time you gently asked, *“Is there anything growing between us that needs to be pulled up?”*

Don’t be afraid to go there.  Don’t wait until it’s overgrown.  Pull the weeds.  Guard the garden.  And watch what God grows in its place.  

*…just a thought.*

What’s one “weed” you’ve identified in your thought life or relationship that needs to be pulled this week?
