Strength is often measured in pounds lifted or miles run, but real strength is tested in moments of service. Carrying groceries for your wife. Helping a neighbor move. Loading heavy supplies for a church event. It’s not glamorous, but it matters.  

The Apostle Paul wrote, *“I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.”* (1 Corinthians 9:27 NIV). For him, physical discipline was never about appearance, it was about stewardship. The body is a vessel for service, and service requires endurance.  

During a church event, two men helped unload supplies. One spent hours in the gym sculpting his body to look strong, but his training wasn’t built for long, practical work. The other had built his strength through years of steady, physical labor. At first, both carried the load, but as the work stretched on, the difference showed. The gym-built man wore out quickly, while the quiet laborer kept going until everything was finished. His strength wasn’t for show; it was for service.  

That picture has stayed with me. Strength that cannot endure isn’t strength you can count on.  

Physical strength and endurance aren’t about vanity, but about usefulness. They prepare us to carry weight for the sake of others, whether that’s literal weight or the steady demands of daily life.  
- **Strength** lets you rise to the occasion when someone needs help.  
- **Endurance** keeps you going when the work doesn’t end in an hour.  

Paul reminded Timothy that *“physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.”* (1 Timothy 4:8 NIV). Training the body has limits, but it does matter, especially when it equips us to serve others well.  

The question isn’t, *How strong are you?* but rather, *Who benefits from your strength?*  

Because true strength is measured not by how much weight you can lift, but by how much you can carry for the good of others.  

…just a thought.
