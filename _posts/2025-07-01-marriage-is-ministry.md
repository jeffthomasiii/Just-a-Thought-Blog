## Marriage IS Ministry

I used to think ministry happened mostly on stages, in pulpits, or mission fields. But somewhere between unspoken expectations, quiet apologies, and Saturday morning dishes, God showed me something deeper. Marriage itself is ministry. And not just any ministry, it’s a picture of the most sacred mystery Paul ever wrote about.

> “This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.”  
> *– Ephesians 5:32*

### The Mystery Within the Mundane

In Ephesians 5, Paul lays out roles in marriage that, to modern ears, sound outdated or even controversial. But beneath the surface of “wives, submit” and “husbands, love,” is a radical, spiritual parallel: marriage is designed to reflect Christ’s relationship with His Bride, the Church.

Paul isn’t simply giving household rules. He’s unveiling a divine metaphor. The way a husband sacrificially loves, leads, and lays down his life for his wife, and the way a wife responds with trust, honor, and devotion, it’s all meant to point to Jesus. That’s the mystery.

Not a metaphor we came up with to illustrate marriage. A metaphor God ordained to illustrate the gospel.

### Marriage as Gospel Proclamation

This means our marriages preach. Whether we intend them to or not, they’re saying something about the character of Christ and His covenant love. The question is: what are they preaching?

If Christ never abandons, never manipulates, never belittles His Bride…  
If the Church is called to respond with trust, loyalty, and reverent love…  
Then every act of forgiveness, patience, service, and unity in marriage becomes a gospel message lived out.

That’s ministry.

Ministry isn't always public. Sometimes it's private, even painfully so. It's showing up when you'd rather shut down. It's praying through misunderstanding instead of powering through with pride. It's remembering your spouse isn’t the enemy, selfishness is. And you're both in the battle together.

### When Ministry Feels Like Work

There’s a reason Paul starts the whole chapter with, *“Walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us…”* (Eph. 5:2). Love in marriage will cost you. It’s meant to. Just like Christ’s love cost Him everything.

We often say ministry requires sacrifice, but forget that marriage does too. Not just the wedding vows, but the daily choices. Dying to self, listening when you’d rather defend, speaking gently when emotions run hot, these are ministry moments. And they’re not wasted.

God isn’t just using your marriage to shape your spouse. He’s using it to shape you.

### The Bigger Picture

Your marriage is bigger than your feelings. It’s bigger than compatibility charts or love languages. It’s a living testimony of covenant love, imperfect, yes, but powerful when anchored in Christ.

We don’t always see it that way. Sometimes we reduce marriage to a contract. Sometimes we idolize it as the source of our joy. But Paul reminds us: the ultimate joy is in knowing Christ, and marriage, at its best, helps us reflect Him and know Him more.

That makes it ministry.

Not because it’s easy. Not because it’s glamorous. But because it’s holy.

…just a thought.
