#### The Oldest Excuse in the Book
It’s one of the oldest moves in the book. When God confronted Adam after the Fall, his reply wasn’t a confession but a deflection:  
*“The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.”* (Genesis 3:12)  

In a single sentence, Adam shifted the weight away from himself, pointing to both God and Eve. The tragedy wasn’t just the sin, but the refusal to own responsibility. And if we’re honest, we as men often fall into the same pattern.


#### How Men Still Echo Adam
It shows up in subtle, everyday ways:  
- **“If she respected me more, I’d love her better.”**  
  He comes home from work, tired. A small comment from her stings, and instead of leaning in with patience, his thoughts retreat: *“She doesn’t respect me, why should I go out of my way to love her?”* His love becomes conditional, tied to her behavior instead of his calling.  

- **“Work is just too demanding right now; she knows I can’t be fully present.”**  
  The laptop glows late into the night. She offers tea and a chance to talk, but the reply is quick: *“Just a few more things.”* Weeks roll by this way. Deep down he tells himself, *“She understands. I’ll reconnect when things slow down.”* But the truth is, the slowdown never comes, and presence gets traded away.  

- **“I wouldn’t be angry if she didn’t push my buttons.”**  
  They’re running late, and he snaps. Later he justifies it: *“If she hadn’t said it that way, I wouldn’t have lost it.”* Instead of owning his reaction, he pins it on her tone.  

Each moment feels reasonable. But like Adam’s words, they shift the weight. We protect ourselves instead of embracing the responsibility given to us.


#### The Objection That Proves the Point  
I can almost hear the objection: *“Why are we the ones who always have to…?”*  

But that question itself illustrates the point. It’s Adam’s move all over again, deflecting instead of embracing. The truth is, yes, wives also have responsibilities in marriage. Scripture is clear about that. But their role isn’t ours to manage. Ours is to love.  

And here’s the hard truth: if my love for my wife rises and falls based on her behavior, then it isn’t love. At least not the kind Christ modeled. His love wasn’t conditional. It wasn’t offered when we “deserved it.” He chose to bear responsibility, even when it wasn’t His fault, because that’s what true love does.  


#### Christ: The Better Adam
Where Adam deflected, Christ embraced. He bore a cross that wasn’t His fault but was His responsibility.  
- **In Gethsemane**, He prayed, “Not my will, but yours be done” (Luke 22:42).  
- **On the road to Calvary**, He carried the weight of sins He never committed (Isaiah 53:5).  
- **On the cross**, He declared, “Father, forgive them” (Luke 23:34), taking responsibility for reconciliation when blame would have been easier.  

This is the model for husbands: not blame-shifting, but burden-bearing. Not ducking responsibility, but stepping into it with sacrificial love.  


#### Tending the Garden of Marriage
Every marriage is its own kind of garden. A place of beauty that also requires tending, guarding, and nourishing. Adam abandoned that call. Christ fulfilled it. And we as husbands are invited to follow His example.  

It’s not about being flawless, it’s about being faithful. About choosing responsibility over excuses. About saying, “I’ll carry this, even when it’s not my fault, because God entrusted me to love and lead.”  


#### The Question Every Husband Faces
So here’s the real question: when tension rises, will we echo Adam;*“the woman you gave me”* or Christ;*“the burden I’ll carry for her good”*?  

One deflects. The other embraces. One leaves the garden in ruins. The other restores it with love.  

…just a thought.
