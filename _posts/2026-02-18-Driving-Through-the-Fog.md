It was the kind of fog that makes you slow down instinctively.

The kind that swallows streetlights and blurs the edges of everything familiar. Headlights stretch out only a few yards before dissolving into white. The horizon disappears. The road seems to vanish right in front of you.

From a distance, it looked impenetrable. Thick. Suffocating. Almost alive.

But there I was, already in it.

The fog did not rush me. It did not scream. It simply existed. Quiet and heavy. It wrapped around the car and pressed gently against the windshield, as if daring me to stop.

And I felt it. The hesitation.

What if I cannot see what is ahead?  
What if something is in the road?  
What if I drive into something I did not expect?

Is that not what stress feels like?  
Is that not what anxiety whispers?

It rarely announces itself with thunder. More often, it rolls in quietly. A thought here. A scenario there. A “what if” that lingers just long enough to cloud what used to feel clear.

From a distance, it looks overwhelming. It looks thick enough to lose yourself in.

But here is what I noticed as I kept driving.

Though I could not see as far as I did before, I could still see enough.

The fog did not remove my vision completely. It shortened it. The road was still there, just not all of it at once. The lines on the pavement appeared only when I was close enough to need them. The curve in the road revealed itself only when I approached it.

Step by step. Yard by yard.

The thickness that once looked immovable began to move.

Not because it disappeared, but because I moved.

That is the part we do not always consider with stress, worry, or even depression. We stand at the edge of it and convince ourselves it is too thick to walk through. We imagine the entire road must be visible before we take the first step.

But life rarely works that way.

Scripture does not say His Word is a floodlight to our future. It says, “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” (Psalm 119:105)

A lamp to my feet.

That is fog language.

It is just enough light for the next step. Just enough clarity to keep moving. Just enough direction to stay on the road.

Anxiety demands certainty.  
Faith settles for obedience.

When I was driving through that fog, I did not need to see the destination. I only needed to see the next few yards. And as long as I kept moving at a steady, cautious pace, the fog kept giving way, slowly and quietly.

Stress works the same way.

When we stop moving forward, when we freeze, replay scenarios, and allow “what if” to paralyze us, the fog feels thicker. Heavier. More permanent. But when we take one faithful step, make the call, send the email, have the conversation, pray the prayer, show up anyway, the fog does not necessarily vanish.

It shifts.

It retreats just enough to let us breathe.

And then something subtle happens.

We realize the fog was never as solid as it appeared from a distance. It was intimidating, yes. Limiting, yes. But not impenetrable.

We could see enough.

Maybe that is where some of us are right now.

The stress feels heavy.  
The future feels unclear.  
The weight feels thick.

> But what if you do not need the entire road today? What if you just need the next step?

Keep driving.

Keep praying.

Keep showing up.

Keep moving.

The fog may not lift instantly. But if you continue forward, you will eventually notice more light breaking through. The horizon will return. The road will widen again.

And one day you will glance in the rearview mirror and realize you drove through something that once felt impossible.

You did not conquer the fog by staring at it.

You moved through it.

…just a thought.
