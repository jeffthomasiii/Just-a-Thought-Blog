Have you ever caught yourself replaying a worry on loop, like a mental broken record? Or maybe a conversation from earlier in the day keeps circling your mind? Whether we realize it or not, we’re always meditating on something.

## Context & Reflection

In Psalm 119:15, the writer says, *“I will muse upon Your precepts and look upon Your ways.”* That word *muse*, or *meditate* in other translations, isn't passive. It comes from a Hebrew word that means to ***mutter, ponder, or speak under your breath***. It’s the image of someone chewing slowly on truth, repeating it again and again until it becomes part of them.

Biblical meditation shows up all over Scripture. In Psalm 1, the righteous person is described as one who meditates on God’s law day and night. In Joshua 1:8, God connects meditation directly to courageous, obedient living. And throughout Psalm 119, meditation is portrayed as both a source of delight and a pathway to wisdom.

It’s more than thinking. It’s shaping your heart through repeated attention to God’s truth.

## Development

Unlike the meditation the world often promotes, biblical meditation isn’t about emptying your mind, it’s about **filling it** with the Word of God. Where Eastern and New Age philosophies aim to detach from the world, biblical meditation roots us more deeply in truth, presence, and relationship.

Here’s a quick comparison:

| **Biblical Meditation**                         | **Non-Biblical Meditation**                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Fills the mind with God’s Word                  | Empties the mind of all thought                |
| Focuses on God’s character and ways             | Focuses on self, breath, or abstract ideas     |
| Anchored in relationship with a personal God    | Often seeks detachment or impersonal oneness  |
| Leads to transformation and obedience           | Aims for peace through escape or self-focus   |

The difference isn’t just philosophical, it’s spiritual. Scripture tells us in Romans 12:2 to *“be transformed by the renewal of your mind,”* not the removal of it. When we meditate on Scripture, we invite God to renew our patterns of thinking and help us walk in truth.

And the benefits? They're not abstract. Biblical meditation leads to peace (Isaiah 26:3), wisdom (Psalm 119:99), courage (Joshua 1:8), and a deeper intimacy with God (Psalm 63:6).

But here’s the key: it's not just about *knowing* the Word, it’s about *dwelling* in it. Speaking it aloud. Reflecting on it during the commute. Letting it shape your responses in conflict. Repeating it when you're afraid. Whispering it when you're alone.

Biblical meditation is less about what you’re doing and more about who you're becoming.

## Resolution or Open-Ended Reflection

So what if we started with just one verse?

One verse we repeat at lunch. One we reflect on in the carpool line. One we pray before bed.

Meditation isn’t about perfection, it’s about pursuit. A quiet, steady returning to God’s voice in a noisy world.

**…just a thought.**

**What’s one verse you can start meditating on this week? How might that simple practice shift your mindset or strengthen your connection with God?**
