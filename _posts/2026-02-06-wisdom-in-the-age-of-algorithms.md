> **“Study to show yourself approved, because AI won’t stand before God in your place.”**

There’s something sobering about typing a prompt into a chatbot and getting a clean sermon outline in seconds. Relevant scriptures. Catchy alliteration. Even a closing prayer. It’s fast. It’s polished. But is it wise?

Because here’s the thing: AI can assist your study, but it can’t approve it.

The rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, Logos AI Assist, and generative sermon builders has created a new dynamic in ministry. On one hand, they save time. They surface commentary, summarize themes, and suggest talking points faster than you can turn a page.

But as helpful as these tools are, they quietly tempt us to bypass the process God uses to form us.

Paul’s charge to Timothy wasn’t to be quick or clever. It was to be faithful.

> "Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth."  
> —2 Timothy 2:15 ESV

There’s no shortcut to that kind of approval. It doesn’t come from a tool. It comes from study. From wrestling with the text. From being shaped by the Word long before we speak it to others.

AI can mimic clarity. But it cannot carry conviction.

It’s tempting to lean on AI when we’re pressed for time or overwhelmed by ministry demands. And for certain tasks, like summarizing commentaries, suggesting illustrations, or even brainstorming outlines, AI can be a faithful assistant.

But an assistant is not an authority.

When it comes to teaching, preaching, discipling, and counseling, we aren’t just sharing content; we are stewarding truth. And that truth must first pass through our own obedience, prayer, and discernment.

> "The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere."  
> —James 3:17 ESV

Can AI generate content? Absolutely. But can it produce wisdom from above? Not a chance.

That kind of wisdom comes from God, through time in His Word, by the leading of the Holy Spirit.

Before we ask AI what to say, we must first ask God what He wants to form in us. Because ministry isn’t just about getting the words right. It’s about being made right through the Word.

We’re not wrong to use the tools available to us. But we’d be unwise to let them do what only the Spirit can.

So yes, leverage AI for support, but don’t outsource your study. Don’t trade communion with God for convenience with a prompt.

Because when you stand to teach, lead, write, or preach, AI won’t be the one accountable for your words. You will.

Just a thought.
