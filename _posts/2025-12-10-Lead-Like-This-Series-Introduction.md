Sometimes leadership sneaks up on you. One day you’re just trying to do the right thing, and before you know it, someone is watching the way you carry yourself, listening to the way you speak, or following the choices you make. Most of us never apply for leadership, it finds us in the quiet places of life long before it finds us in the public ones.

And honestly? Leadership has a way of exposing what’s really inside of us. Not to shame us, but to shape us.

Over the years, I’ve noticed that most leadership challenges aren’t actually about strategy, tools, or structure. They usually come from something deeper, tired hearts, unaddressed fears, ego disguised as confidence, or good intentions that got tangled in pressure. We read the books, take the courses, study the models, and yet the hardest work of leadership is still the heart work.

Maybe that’s why Scripture spends so much time shaping a leader’s character rather than refining a leader’s technique. God seems far more concerned with *who we are becoming* than the positions we hold or the influence we’re trying to build.

That’s what this series, **Lead Like This**, is all about.

It isn’t a leadership manual. It’s a reflective journey.  
It isn’t about platform. It’s about posture.  
It isn’t about leading bigger. It’s about leading truer.

Over the next few posts, we’re going to look at seven qualities of a leader God forms from the inside out:

- **A servant’s heart instead of a controlling grip.**  
- **Humility that shows up rather than insecurity that hides.**  
- **An ear that listens before the mouth speaks.**  
- **Character (“fruit”) that stabilizes passion (“fire”).**  
- **Vision rooted in revelation, not mere ambition.**  
- **The courage to let go and trust others.**  
- **A life God can entrust with influence.**

These aren’t checkboxes. They’re transformations. And they don’t happen overnight, they happen in the slow, steady work of walking with Jesus through real life.

If God is giving you influence, whether it’s in your marriage, your workplace, your ministry, your friendships, or simply the people who watch how you live, this series is for you. You don’t have to be a “leader” in title. Influence doesn’t wait for titles. It grows wherever character grows.

My hope is that these reflections help you slow down, breathe a little deeper, and let God shape the parts of leadership that no one else sees but everyone else feels.

So before we talk about leading anyone else, let’s start with the question that shapes all true leadership:

**Who am I becoming under God’s hand?**

…just a thought.
