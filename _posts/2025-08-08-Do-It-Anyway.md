excerpt: "When someone mistreats you, it's easy to pull back or match their energy. But what if you stayed rooted in who God called you to be? Do it anyway—because that's who you are."

You hold the door open. They walk through without a glance.  
No “thank you.” No smile. Just… silence.  

It’s minor—but something inside you clenches. *Seriously?*  
You think, *Next time, I won’t bother.*  

But what if you did it anyway?

What if you chose to become who you’re called to be, not what they deserve in that moment?

### We All Adjust—But Sometimes in the Wrong Direction

There’s a quiet battle that plays out in everyday moments:  
Will I let their behavior change me?  
Will I respond in kind, or will I respond in character?

Whether it’s a stranger’s rudeness, a co-worker’s coldness, or a spouse’s indifference—something happens inside us when we feel disrespected or unseen. We want to pull back. Withdraw. Match the energy.

But here's the problem:  
Their behavior wasn’t Christlike… and now ours isn’t either.

### Love Doesn’t Echo—It Anchors

In marriage, this is a familiar dance.  
One spouse snaps, the other defends.  
One shuts down, the other walks away.  

And suddenly, both are becoming someone they don’t want to be.  

But what if love didn’t echo?  
What if it *anchored* instead—choosing to stay kind, grounded, and true even when the other person isn’t at their best?

This isn’t about pretending. It’s not about enabling harmful behavior or stuffing your feelings. It’s about refusing to let someone else’s brokenness rewrite your character.

You can set boundaries *and* still show grace.  
You can speak truth *without* losing tenderness.  
You can confront sin *without* becoming sinful.  

That’s maturity. That’s spiritual strength.

### A Personal Reflection: Lessons That Stuck

This is something my wife lives every day.  
She’s one of the most kindhearted, understanding, compassionate, and strong people I know. But when you carry that kind of light in a world that often feels cold or indifferent, it’s only natural to feel the tension:  
*Why bother being kind when people are unkind?*  
*Why keep loving when it doesn’t seem to be returned?*

My response to her is often simple:  
**“Because that’s who you are.”**

Years ago, when I was just starting to face the weight of adult relationships—betrayals, letdowns, and miscommunication—I remember hearing my Annette tell me something that didn’t fully sink in at the time:  
> *“Don’t allow other people’s behavior to change your character.”*

I nodded. Agreed. Moved on.  
But it wasn’t until years later—after applying it over and over, often the hard way—that I realized: **that’s just who I am now.**

Over time, it’s become one of the things I’m known for:  
- Consistency in character.  
- Consistency in behavior.  
- Consistency in integrity.

Not because I never get frustrated.  
Not because I don’t notice how people act.  
But because I finally understood—*they don’t get to decide who I become.*

### Jesus Loved Anyway

Jesus didn’t wait for people to behave right before He did right.  
He *washed Judas’ feet*—knowing the betrayal coming.  
He *forgave Peter*, knowing the denial that echoed just hours before.  
And from the cross, He prayed for His enemies.

He *did it anyway.*

Romans 12:21 reminds us:  
> *“Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.”*

That doesn’t mean it’s easy.  
It means it’s *possible.*


### In Marriage, and Everywhere Else

I believe marriage teaches us how to love others.
Imagine your spouse is off. Quiet. Distant.  
You could mirror it, stay cold, hold back affection, keep score.  
Or…  
You could cook the meal, say the kind word, offer the gentle touch.  
You could *do it anyway.*

That doesn’t make you weak.  
That makes you *free*, free from needing their behavior to justify your own.

Galatians 6:9 puts it like this:  
> *“Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.”*

Even if you’re tired.  
Even if they’re difficult.  
Even if no one claps or thanks you or changes.

You keep choosing love, not because they deserve it, but because that’s who *you* are becoming in Christ.

### You Don’t Have to Change… Just Because They Did

The truth is, love that only lasts when it’s easy… isn’t love.  
Joy that disappears when people disappoint… isn’t rooted.  
Kindness that vanishes when others are rude… isn’t fruit.  

The call of Christ is deeper than that.  
He invites us to love with *His* love, not just our leftover energy.

So today, when someone rolls their eyes, ignores your effort, or treats you like your kindness doesn’t matter…

Do it anyway.

Because who you’re becoming matters more than how they’re behaving.

**…just a thought.**
