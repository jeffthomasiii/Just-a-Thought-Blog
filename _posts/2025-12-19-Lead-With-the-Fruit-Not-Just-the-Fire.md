There is something energizing about fire. Passion. Drive. Vision. The spark that makes a leader move and makes others want to move with them. Fire can start something powerful. Fire can gather people. Fire can break inertia and stir hope.

But fire alone cannot sustain anything.

Many leaders burn brightly for a moment, but their impact fades because their passion outpaced their character. Their intensity ran ahead of their integrity. Their gifts grew faster than their roots. Fire can draw people in, but only fruit can help them stay.

When Paul describes the fruit of the Spirit, he is not listing personality traits or natural strengths. He is describing the visible evidence of God at work within a person. Love. Joy. Peace. Patience. Kindness. Goodness. Faithfulness. Gentleness. Self-control. These qualities may not be as loud as fire, but they are far more durable. They build trust. They calm tension. They stabilize teams and relationships. They reveal who a leader really is beneath the energy.

Fire is impressive. Fruit is trustworthy.

Every leader needs some fire. God uses passion. He uses conviction. He uses urgency and clarity and focus. But passion without the fruit of the Spirit can quickly become pushy, sharp, impatient, or self-centered. It can create movement without maturity. It can stir excitement without shaping hearts.

Fruit is slower than fire. It takes time to grow. It requires seasons. It requires pruning and patience. But fruit changes the environment around it. It brings life, nourishment, and stability. People feel safe around a leader who consistently shows love, patience, and self-control. They can breathe. They can grow.

There is a quiet strength in a leader who refuses to sacrifice fruit for the sake of fire. A leader who guards their tone even when they feel urgency. A leader who chooses gentleness in high pressure moments. A leader who protects peace when everything feels chaotic. A leader who holds fast to faithfulness when others are drifting.

A leader shaped by fruit may not always be the loudest voice in the room, but they will often be the one people trust when things get difficult.

So ask yourself.  
Is my leadership driven more by energy or by character.  
Do people experience my passion more than my patience.  
Do they feel my urgency or my gentleness.  
Do they leave conversations inspired yet unsettled, or encouraged and strengthened.

Fire can spark a movement.  
Fruit can sustain one.

The Holy Spirit produces the fruit. Our job is to remain close enough to Him that the fruit becomes visible in the way we lead and the way we love.

Lead with the fruit, not just the fire. Both matter, but one lasts longer.

…just a thought.
