Sometimes the most damaging words are not planned.  

They are reactive.  

They are typed quickly.  
Spoken quickly.  
Sent before we have had time to think.

My wife has a phrase she uses when she senses emotion rising in a moment.

“Bite the bagel.”

Not bite the bullet.  
Not power through.  
Not prove your point.

Bite the bagel.

It is her way of saying pause.  
Take a breath.  
Put something between the impulse and the response.

The more I reflect on it, the more I realize how much wisdom is packed into that simple phrase.

There are moments when I can feel it coming.

A tightening in my chest.  
A rush of thoughts.  
A defensiveness that feels justified.  
Anxiety when something feels uncertain.  
Frustration when something feels unfair.

We all have patterns.

Some of us withdraw.  
Some of us escalate.  
Some of us get sarcastic.  
Some of us over explain.

The issue is not that we feel those emotions. The issue is when we let them drive.

Scripture gives surprisingly practical wisdom here.

*“Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.”*  
-James 1:19

Slow to speak.  
Slow to anger.

That requires awareness.

You cannot slow something down if you do not know it is speeding up.

There is always a small gap between what happens to us and how we respond. Most of the time, that gap feels microscopic.

An email comes in.  
A comment is made.  
A tone is misunderstood.  
An expectation is not met.

And we react.

But what if we widened that gap?

> What if instead of responding immediately, we bit the bagel?

Take a breath.  
Count to ten.  
Walk around the block.  
Draft the email but do not send it.  
Pray before replying.

That pause does something powerful.

It gives clarity a chance to catch up with emotion.  
It gives wisdom time to speak.  
It allows professionalism to override pride.

It keeps us from saying things we later have to apologize for.

Part of growing up, spiritually and emotionally, is knowing your own tendencies.

If you know you respond defensively when criticized, bite the bagel.  
If you know uncertainty makes you anxious, bite the bagel.  
If you know you fire off texts when you are frustrated, bite the bagel.

This is not weakness.

It is strength under control.

“Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.”  
Proverbs 16:32

Ruling your spirit is harder than ruling a boardroom.  
Harder than winning an argument.  
Harder than proving a point.

And far more valuable.

When we do not pause, we often speak from insecurity, fear, ego, or exhaustion. When we do pause, we have the opportunity to speak from conviction instead of emotion.

Clear.  
Precise.  
Professional.  
Gracious.

The pause does not remove emotion. It refines it.

It asks:

Is this worth responding to?  
Is this the right tone?  
Is this helpful?  
Is this aligned with who I say I am?

Sometimes the most mature response is silence.

Sometimes it is a delayed response.

Sometimes it is a softer response.

But almost always, it is a thoughtful one.

Imagine how many unnecessary conflicts would dissolve if we paused more.

How many marriages would feel safer.  
How many workplaces would feel healthier.  
How many friendships would avoid unnecessary fractures.

Not because we stopped feeling.

But because we stopped reacting immediately.

“Bite the bagel” may sound lighthearted. But it might be one of the most practical forms of wisdom we practice daily.

Before you reply.  
Before you defend.  
Before you escalate.

Bite the bagel.

…just a thought.
