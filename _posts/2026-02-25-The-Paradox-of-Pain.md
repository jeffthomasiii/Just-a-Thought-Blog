It’s still dark.

The stadium lights hum against the quiet of early morning. The scoreboard is blank. The bleachers sit empty. No crowd. No applause. No one watching.

Just breath rising in the cold air.

Cleats press into turf still wet with dew. The whistle cuts through the silence.

*“Go.”*

The first sprint feels clean. Strong. Controlled.

The second tightens the lungs.

By the fourth, the burn spreads. Thighs grow heavy. Breath shortens. What began smooth now feels forced.

Sprint.  
Walk back.  
Sprint.  
Walk back.

From a distance it looks simple. Repetition. Conditioning. Effort.

From the inside, it feels like unraveling.

By the seventh sprint, the mind whispers:

This is too much.  
You’ve already done enough.  
No one would blame you for easing up.

The body interprets stress as damage. Every stride feels like something microscopic is tearing. The chest tightens. The legs tremble. Doubt creeps in quietly but convincingly.

The whistle blows again.

*“Again.”*

In that moment, it doesn’t feel like development.

It feels like punishment.

No trophy. No celebration. Just private strain and a coach who refuses to lower the standard.

And yet, something invisible is happening.

Muscle fibers rebuild stronger.  
Lungs expand capacity.  
Endurance forms where weakness once dominated.

What feels like breaking is actually becoming.

Months later, the stadium is full.

Lights blazing. Crowd roaring. Fourth quarter. The game on the line.

The same athlete. The same legs.

But now, while others slow, he steadies. While others panic, he presses forward. What once felt unbearable has become instinct.

No one in the stands saw the empty mornings.  
No one applauded the repetition.  
No one felt the burn.

But the strength on display was forged there.

The pain was not punishment.

It was preparation.

Training only makes sense in hindsight.

In the moment, it feels excessive. Unnecessary. Even unkind.

But later, when strength shows up where weakness used to live, the athlete realizes what he couldn’t see in the dark:

The coach wasn’t trying to break him.

He was building him.

Scripture says something almost unsettlingly similar.

*“For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant…”*

Not might seem.  
Seems painful.

The Bible does not sanitize it. It names what we feel.

*“…but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.”*

Not to everyone who experiences pain.

To those who are trained by it.

Training is different than simply enduring.

An athlete can resent practice and still finish it. He can go through the motions and miss the growth entirely. He can suffer and remain unchanged.

Pain alone does not produce maturity.

Training does.

And spiritual discipline works the same way.

Sometimes that training looks like unanswered prayer.

You asked God to ease the tension in your marriage, and the conversation got harder before it got better.

You prayed for clarity, and instead you found yourself in a waiting season longer than you expected.

You stepped out in obedience, and the opportunity quietly fell apart.

You tried to respond gently, and you were misunderstood anyway.

It does not feel like formation.

It feels like disappointment.

It can even feel like distance.

But we should be careful here.

Not all pain is discipline.

Some suffering is simply the result of living in a broken world. Loss, illness, betrayal, tragedy. Scripture never flattens those into spiritual workouts.

God is not casually assigning grief as a drill.

Hebrews is speaking about formative discipline. The kind that exposes pride, stretches trust, strengthens obedience, and reshapes character.

And when that kind of discipline comes, it will feel painful.

But it will not be pointless.

A coach disciplines the athlete he intends to put in the game.

A father disciplines the child he intends to mature, not reject.

God disciplines the sons and daughters He loves.

Not to shame them.

To shape them.

There is a kind of hardship that hardens you.

And there is a kind that humbles you.

One builds walls.

The other builds endurance.

The difference is not the pain.

It is whether you allow yourself to be trained by it.

The peaceful fruit of righteousness does not grow in comfort. It grows where trust deepens. Where pride loosens. Where patience stretches beyond what you thought you had.

Sometimes the very thing you are asking God to remove is the very thing He is using to steady you.

Sometimes what feels like breaking is actually becoming.

And later, when you find yourself responding with patience where you once reacted in anger…  
When you remain steady in a storm that would have undone you years ago…  
When you obey more quickly, trust more deeply, and panic less easily…

You may look back and realize:

The pain was not punishment.

It was preparation.

The question is not whether discipline hurts.

It does.

The question is how you will interpret it while you are in it.

Will you see it as rejection?

Or refinement?

Will you resist it?

Or be trained by it?

Because the athlete who understands the purpose of the drill endures it differently.

And the believer who understands the heart of the Father does too.

Perhaps what you are feeling right now is not evidence that God has stepped back.

Perhaps it is evidence that He is shaping you.

…just a thought.
