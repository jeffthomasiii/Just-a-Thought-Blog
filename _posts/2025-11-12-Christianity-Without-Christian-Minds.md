There’s a line from R. Kent Hughes’ *Disciplines of a Godly Man* that refuses to leave me:  
> *“This cosmic potential of the believer’s mind introduced the great scandal of today's church: Christianity without Christian minds, that is, Christians who do not think Christianly...”*

It’s a sobering observation. Hughes is not talking about intelligence or education, but about the orientation of our minds, how we process truth, evaluate culture, and respond to life. His concern wasn’t with Christians who don’t *believe*, but with believers who no longer *think like believers.*,

The scandal Hughes saw was not a lack of passion, but a lack of thought.  
In many ways, his words sound prophetic today. We have more access to biblical resources than any generation before us, podcasts, devotionals, study apps, online sermons, yet fewer believers seem to know *why* they believe what they claim to believe.  

Our faith has become increasingly reactive, shaped by algorithms more than Scripture. Social media gives us slogans to repost but not truths to wrestle with. We are quick to emote, slow to discern. We mistake agreement for conviction and inspiration for transformation.  

Hughes calls this a *scandal* because Christianity without thought eventually becomes Christianity without depth. When the Church loses her intellectual edge, she loses her prophetic voice. She becomes another echo in a noisy world rather than a light cutting through it.  

Romans 12:2 reminds us that transformation begins not in the heart’s emotion but in the mind’s renewal. “Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” The Spirit doesn’t bypass our intellect, He sanctifies it.,

So what does it mean to think Christianly?  
To think Christianly is not simply to think about Christian things, it is to think *through* a Christian lens about everything. It’s to interpret reality through the character of Christ, the truth of Scripture, and the wisdom of the Spirit.  

It’s asking, *How does the gospel reshape the way I view success, justice, suffering, or identity?* It’s refusing to divide the sacred from the secular. Thinking Christianly means that the same faith that guides your prayer life also guides how you vote, work, rest, and treat others.  

It’s an invitation to see the world as God sees it, not merely with compassion, but with clarity.,

The cost of an unthinking faith is subtle but devastating.  
When we neglect the discipline of mind, our faith becomes sentimental rather than spiritual. We’re easily swayed by persuasive personalities or popular ideologies that sound compassionate but lack biblical conviction.  

We start confusing *niceness* with *kindness*, *affirmation* with *love*, and *success* with *blessing.* We drift from conviction to comfort. We become spiritually undernourished yet emotionally overstimulated.  

An unthinking church becomes a vulnerable church, one that reacts to the world instead of reforming it. And the tragedy, as Hughes reminds us, is that believers are meant to possess the *mind of Christ* (1 Corinthians 2:16). The potential for divine perspective is already within us, but it must be cultivated, not assumed.,

Recovering this discipline of mind begins with humility, the kind that admits how easily we settle for borrowed convictions.  
The goal isn’t to become a scholar, but a steward of thought. A Christian mind is not merely informed, it is *transformed*, shaped by the Spirit through discipline and devotion.

Here are a few ways we can begin:  
- **Read deeply.** Go beyond the verse of the day. Sit with Scripture until it shapes how you think, not just how you feel.  
- **Reflect prayerfully.** Thinking Christianly isn’t about accumulating knowledge but seeking wisdom that leads to obedience.  
- **Engage culture thoughtfully.** Listen, learn, and discern without conforming. Christ calls us to be in the world but not of it.  
- **Ask better questions.** Before reacting, pause and ask: *What’s true here? What’s good? What’s eternal?*  
- **Pursue wise community.** Surround yourself with those who sharpen both your heart and your intellect. Iron sharpens iron, dull thinking dulls faith.

This kind of spiritual thoughtfulness is not optional. It’s part of loving God with *all* our mind (Matthew 22:37). To think Christianly is to worship intelligently, to see with renewed eyes, and to live with conviction shaped by truth rather than trend.


We live in an age of quick takes and short attention spans, yet the kingdom of God still calls us to long obedience and deep reflection.  

The Church doesn’t need more noise; it needs renewed minds.  
And maybe that renewal begins not in grand debates or viral posts, but in the quiet decision of one believer who refuses to think like the world anymore.  

Every time we take a thought captive, every time we choose Scripture over speculation, every time we love God with our minds, the darkness loses ground.  
The gospel shines a little brighter.  

Maybe the next time we scroll, react, or speak, we could pause and ask:  
*Am I thinking Christianly about this?*  

Because when we do, the world catches a glimpse of what a transformed mind, and a transformed life, really looks like.  

…just a thought.
