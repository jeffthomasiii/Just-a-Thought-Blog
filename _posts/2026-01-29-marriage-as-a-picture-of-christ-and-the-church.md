There are seasons in marriage where you start asking quieter questions.

Not, *How do we fix this?*  
But, *What is this for?*

Because the longer you’re married, the more you realize marriage is not just a relationship you maintain. It’s something that keeps revealing what you believe about love, sacrifice, forgiveness, and power. Sometimes it reveals it gently. Sometimes it reveals it painfully. Either way, it reveals.

And then Scripture adds a layer that is both comforting and weighty.

Paul doesn’t describe marriage as merely practical. He describes it as meaningful. In **[Ephesians 5:25–27 (ESV)](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/EPH.5.25-27.esv)**, he speaks of Christ’s love for the church in terms that feel almost too holy to sit next to everyday arguments and tired evenings. Christ loved. Christ gave Himself. Christ cleanses. Christ presents His people to Himself.

That isn’t language meant to elevate marriage.  
It’s language meant to magnify Jesus.

And if we’re honest, that’s where some of us get uncomfortable. Because we know our marriages are imperfect. We know our love is inconsistent. We know how quickly we can become self-protective, self-focused, or simply tired. So when we hear that marriage reflects Christ and the church, it can feel like pressure.

But I don’t think God gives us this picture to crush us. I think He gives it to re-center us.

The point isn’t, *Look how great your marriage should be.*  
The point is, *Look how great Christ already is.*

Marriage becomes a kind of living parable. Not because couples are holy on their own, but because God delights in using ordinary people to point toward extraordinary truth. In a world that treats love as a contract, marriage is meant to whisper covenant. In a world that treats commitment like a mood, marriage is meant to whisper faithfulness. In a world that treats people as disposable, marriage is meant to whisper, *I’m still here.*

That doesn’t mean marriage always feels warm. Sometimes it looks like choosing obedience in small ways when you’d rather retreat. Sometimes it looks like listening before defending. Confessing before explaining. Serving without keeping score.

Ephesians 5 is striking because it doesn’t center romance. It centers sacrifice. When Paul calls husbands to love, he points them to Christ’s self-giving love, not leadership as control. Christ did not love the church by demanding more from her. He loved by giving Himself for her.

That kind of love changes a home. Not dominance. Not performance. Not winning. Just steady, costly, other-centered love that seeks a spouse’s good.

And while this passage speaks directly to husbands, the picture is larger than a single role. It’s about how the gospel shapes two people who keep choosing covenant over convenience. It’s about a marriage that learns to say, *My goal is not to get my way. My goal is to reflect Him.*

Even then, we do it imperfectly. We repent often. We restart often. We learn slowly.

That, too, is part of the beauty.

Marriage reflecting Christ and the church does not mean your marriage never struggles. It means your marriage is invited to keep turning toward the pattern of Christ, His humility, His patience, His purity, His faithfulness, His love that moves first.

Sometimes the most Christlike moment in a marriage isn’t a grand spiritual milestone. It’s a quiet apology. A soft answer. A decision to stay engaged. A willingness to pray when you don’t feel like praying. A choice to seek peace without pretending everything is fine.

> If marriage is a picture, then the question becomes less *How do I get the marriage I want?* and more *What do we want our marriage to point to?*

Not perfectly.  
Not performatively.  
But truly.

…just a thought.
