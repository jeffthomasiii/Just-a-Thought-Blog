Sometimes a statement carries weight not because it’s dramatic,  
but because it’s settled.

It isn’t said to inspire.  
It isn’t offered as advice.  
It simply names something that has already been decided.

Those kinds of words tend to surface quietly, usually in the middle of ordinary conversations, when no one is trying to sound profound.

On my birthday, my mother called to wish me well. Like most of our conversations, it wandered. We talked about life, about stress, about the weight people carry that isn’t always visible. Eventually, the conversation drifted toward anxiety, spiritual warfare, and the familiar Scriptures we return to when our hearts feel unsettled.  
> *Cast your cares upon Him.*  
*Let not your heart be troubled.*  
<sub>(phrases drawn from 1 Peter 5:7 and John 14:1, ESV)</sub>

We talked honestly about the tension there. About how knowing God is in control doesn’t always stop emotions from showing up. About how faith doesn’t erase the struggle so much as it gives it a place to rest. It wasn’t a conversation about having it all figured out. It was a conversation about living in the space between truth and feeling.

And somewhere in the middle of that, without emphasis or explanation, she said,  
“If I’m the skin at the very bottom of His feet, I’m still on top of the devil.”

It wasn’t bravado.  
It wasn’t self-contempt.  
It sounded more like orientation than expression.

The line stayed with me because it names something we often miss. Biblical humility is not about diminishing our worth, and confidence is not about standing on our own strength. What matters most is position.

Scripture speaks to this quietly but clearly: *“The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet”* (Romans 16:20, ESV). The promise isn’t grounded in emotional steadiness or personal resolve. It’s grounded in placement. In belonging. In whom we stand beneath, and therefore who we stand above.

The world teaches us to measure ourselves vertically. Higher feels better. More visible feels safer. Stronger seems more secure. Faith rearranges the axis. It asks not how high you stand, but where.

To be beneath Christ is not to be beneath evil.  
To be low before Him is not defeat.  
Proximity settles the hierarchy.

That perspective doesn’t deny anxiety. It doesn’t pretend emotions disappear when the right verse is quoted. It simply reminds us that even when the inner world feels unstable, our placement has not changed. The ground remains firm, even if our knees feel weak.

There’s something freeing about that. It releases us from the pressure to feel strong all the time. It allows fear to be acknowledged without surrendering authority. It teaches us that victory doesn’t come from elevation, but from alignment.

If the lowest place before Christ still places us above what opposes Him, then we don’t need to chase height to be secure. We don’t need to outrun our fear. We don’t need to prove anything.

We just need to know where we stand.

…just a thought.
