excerpt: "Big words might sound smart, but they don't always connect. Whether I’m explaining BIM workflows or leading a couples’ group, the same truth applies: clarity is what makes your words matter."

I give presentations to rooms of twenty and two hundred. Sometimes I’m unpacking technical workflows in Revit or explaining BIM collaboration to a boardroom full of decision-makers. Other times I’m leading a couples' small group or talking about faith and marriage with people I love. The topics vary, but one lesson shows up everywhere:

If people can’t follow your words, they won’t follow your message.

That lesson didn’t come from a communication book. it came from blank stares.

I used to think that using big words, precise, advanced, even academic words, made me sound more credible. But I learned something the hard way: if your goal is to connect with your audience, sounding impressive isn’t the same as *being* impactful.

### Smart Isn’t Always Sounding Smart

Let me be clear, having a strong vocabulary matters. Words are tools. And like any good builder, the more tools you have in your belt, the more capable you are. But wisdom knows *which* tool to use *when.*

Here’s the thing: knowing big words doesn’t mean you need to *use* big words all the time. In fact, in many situations, it can come across as distant… or worse, pretentious.

Jesus had the largest vocabulary of anyone who ever lived, and He chose to speak in stories, questions, and imagery drawn from everyday life. Why? Because love considers the listener.

### Compare the Impact (Not the Intelligence)

Let’s say I’m trying to express a basic idea: *Sometimes big words can get in the way.*

Now, depending on the setting, academic, casual, professional, pastoral, how I say that might sound very different. None of these is "right" or "wrong." The question is: *Which one fits the moment?*

> **A. Academic Tone:**  
> _In the realm of interpersonal discourse, lexical inflation may inadvertently obfuscate rather than elucidate intended meaning._

> **B. Professional/Plain:**  
> _When we communicate with others, using overly complex language can sometimes confuse more than clarify._

> **C. Conversational/Relational:**  
> _Big words don’t always help. If you want people to connect, clarity goes a long way._

Each version communicates the same truth, but in a different voice, for a different kind of audience.

Using big words for the sake of sounding smart can come across as pretentious. But avoiding advanced vocabulary altogether can sometimes feel underprepared in professional or academic settings. The goal isn’t to dumb down or dress up your message, it’s to *deliver* it effectively.

So when you speak… ask yourself: *What’s the clearest way to say this to the people in front of me?*

### When You Love the Listener, You Change the Delivery

Understanding your audience isn’t manipulation, it’s ministry. Whether you're explaining a concept, teaching a truth, or sharing a story, how you speak matters as much as what you say.

Paul reminded the Corinthians that he didn’t come with eloquence or superior wisdom but with a simple, powerful message (1 Corinthians 2:1–5). That wasn’t because Paul wasn’t smart. It’s because he loved his audience too much to let pride get in the way of truth.

So yes, build your vocabulary. Learn new words. Study excellent writing. But don’t let your language be a barrier to connection. Say it simply. Say it clearly. Say it so they hear you.

…just a thought.
