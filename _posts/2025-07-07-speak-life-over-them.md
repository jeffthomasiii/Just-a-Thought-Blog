Have you ever realized you were trying to fix something with good intentions… but the wrong tools?

That was me, not too long ago.

My wife was sharing some deep and personal struggles: anxiety, insecurity, and questions about her worth and identity. I listened. I cared. But instead of praying with her or speaking God’s truth over her, I did what a lot of husbands do, I tried to explain her way out of it. I thought logic would help. I offered advice. But it fell flat.

And honestly, it convicted me.  

I was speaking from my head when she needed words rooted in the Spirit. That realization changed everything.

## What This Series Is About

This 2-part blog series, **_Speak Life Over Them_**, is for husbands and wives who want to intentionally use prayer and Scripture to lift each other in love. It’s for couples who recognize the spiritual battles we face in marriage and want to be better equipped to fight *with* their spouse, not just *for* them.

One post is written for **husbands**: how to pray for and speak life over your wife, especially when she’s tired, overwhelmed, or questioning who she is.

The other is for **wives**: how to intercede for and speak truth over your husband, especially when he’s feeling the weight of pressure, temptation, or spiritual fatigue.

Each post will include:
- **Real struggles** our spouses face, emotionally, spiritually, and relationally  
- **Biblically grounded encouragement** to reshape how we see and speak  
- **Written prayers** and **Scripture-based affirmations** tailored to those struggles  
- **Prayer prompts** to help you put it into practice  


## Why This Matters

What we say, and what we *don’t* say, shapes our homes.  

If we don’t cover each other with truth, the enemy is more than happy to fill that silence with lies.

I believe God has called each of us to be more than providers or supporters in marriage, we are spiritual encouragers and protectors. Our words carry weight. And Scripture gives us everything we need to speak life into the one we love most.

Whether your marriage is thriving, struggling, or somewhere in between, this series is for you. It’s not about being perfect, it’s about being present, prayerful, and intentional.

## Prayer Prompt

Ask the Lord to show you one area your spouse is struggling in that they may not even be talking about. Then pray this simple prayer:

> “God, show me how to speak life over them today, not my opinions, but Your truth. Help me cover their heart with Your Word and love them the way You do.”
