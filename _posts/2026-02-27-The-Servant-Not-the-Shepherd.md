There’s a quiet danger in convenience. The more a tool helps us, the easier it is to forget that it is only a tool. That’s especially true with AI.

It can summarize commentary, suggest applications, polish language, even simulate tone. But it can’t discern the heart of God for the people He’s entrusted to us.

> “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.” - Psalm 23:1 ESV

Not, “The software is my shepherd.”

Ministry will always require trust, but the object of that trust matters. And no matter how smart the machine becomes, it will never walk with us through the valley of the shadow of death. It cannot restore our soul. It cannot lead us in paths of righteousness.

That’s the Shepherd’s work.

AI can help us carry the load. It can bear weight we were never meant to bear alone. But it can’t make the decision about where to walk. It doesn’t know what obedience costs. It doesn’t weep with those who weep. It doesn’t hear God in the quiet.

That means we must not only know what our tools can do, we must remember what they can’t.

We’ve all seen the temptation to let systems define the schedule, platforms define the message, and metrics define the meaning. But the call of ministry was never about output. It was about obedience.

God may use a donkey to speak, but that doesn’t make the donkey the teacher.

When you begin to feel more confidence in the structure you’ve built than the Spirit who called you, it’s time to pause. Ask again who’s leading.

Because the moment the servant starts giving directions, we’ve lost the Shepherd’s voice in the noise.

Let AI serve the mission. But never let it define it.

Just a thought.
