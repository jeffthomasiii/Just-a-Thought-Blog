We’re not usually tempted to abandon our calling in one dramatic decision. The real danger is slower, more polite. It disguises itself in words like “efficiency,” “scalability,” and “best practice.”

That’s how ministry can quietly become management.

AI is an incredible tool. It can organize workflows, manage volunteers, optimize emails, and even schedule your next sermon series based on trending search terms. But if we’re not watchful, the pursuit of effectiveness can become the new obedience.

> "Feed my sheep."  
> -John 21:17 ESV

That’s what Jesus said to Peter. Not “grow your following.” Not “improve engagement.” Not “streamline your systems.”

Feed. My. Sheep.

It’s relational. Messy. Inconvenient. And completely out of sync with the language of automation.

But AI loves patterns. It thrives on predictability. It helps us manage the machine.

Ministry, however, requires something else: attention. Compassion. Presence. Discernment.

Of course, AI can help with administration. It’s not wrong to use it well. But if we’re not careful, we’ll start assessing fruitfulness by productivity, and forget that our highest call is to serve, not just to succeed.

Some of the most fruitful moments in ministry won’t be the ones we planned. They’ll be the late-night call, the unscheduled conversation, the Spirit-led detour.

A manager might call that inefficient.

A shepherd calls it ministry.

AI can remind you to send a follow-up email. But it won’t remind you to check on the tone in someone’s voice. It won’t feel the Holy Spirit's nudge when someone lingers after service. It won’t stop the schedule to sit with someone who’s weeping.

That kind of work is slow. It’s often unseen. And it doesn’t always scale.

But it looks like Jesus.

So yes, use the tools. Organize the systems. But never forget who you are. You weren’t called to run a machine.

You were called to feed sheep.

Just a thought.
