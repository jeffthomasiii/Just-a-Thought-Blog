Most of us do not think of ourselves as controlling. We think we are being responsible, clear, protective, or diligent. But it is surprising how easily leadership can drift from serving people to managing outcomes, from lifting others to gripping tighter, from shepherding to steering.

Control often disguises itself as care.

And the tension is real. How do you lead with strength without slipping into control? How do you steer without squeezing? How do you influence without turning people into projects?

When Jesus talked about leadership, He did not start with authority or position. He did not even start with responsibility. He went straight to the heart.  
> **“Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant...” (Mark 10:43).**

Greatness, in His definition, is not found in control. It is found in service.

But this is where things get uncomfortable. Serving is slower. It is messier. It requires listening, patience, and humility. It means releasing outcomes you cannot guarantee and trusting God with details you cannot see. Control promises efficiency. Service produces transformation.

Every leader eventually faces a crossroads.  
Will I grip tighter or open my hands?  
Will I push people or walk with them?  
Will I lead from insecurity or from love?  

Serving is not weakness. It is strength governed by surrender.  
It is power submitted to purpose.  
It is direction shaped by compassion.  

And if we are honest, the people who have marked our lives most deeply, whether mentors, teachers, parents, pastors, or friends, were not the ones who controlled us. They were the ones who served us. They led by lifting, not by demanding. They influenced by being present, not by being pushy.

Jesus did not win the world by taking control from others.  
He won the world by giving Himself to others.

So maybe leadership is not about becoming the person everyone listens to, but becoming the person everyone learns to trust. And trust is not built through pressure. It is built through posture.

Wherever God has placed you to lead, whether in your home, your workplace, your ministry, your team, or your friendships, start here.

Serve.  
Show up with humility.  
Choose people over pressure.  
Let go of the tight grip.  
Trust God with the results.

It is amazing what opens up when our hands finally do.

…just a thought.
