Some Christians live as if faith were a solo journey. They love God, read His Word, and pray faithfully, but quietly keep their distance from others. Sometimes it’s because of past hurt, sometimes exhaustion, and sometimes it just feels easier. But Christianity was never meant to be lived in isolation.  

R. Kent Hughes once wrote, *“Christianity is a relationship with God and His people.”* I remember pausing the first time I read that line, it’s simple, but it cuts deep. It’s not *either/or*; it’s *both/and.* Our walk with God naturally calls us into relationship with His family.
> God designed faith to flow both upward and outward.  

Even the Ten Commandments reveal this truth. The first four speak to our **vertical** relationship with God, honoring Him, worshiping Him alone, keeping His name holy, and resting in His presence. But the last six turn **horizontal**, guiding how we live with one another, honoring parents, valuing life, keeping covenant, speaking truth, and protecting what belongs to our neighbor. From the very beginning, God designed faith to flow both upward and outward.  

The early church lived that design beautifully. Acts 2 paints a picture of believers who *devoted themselves to fellowship*, breaking bread together, praying together, sharing needs, and rejoicing together. Their connection wasn’t just emotional; it was spiritual. They didn’t simply meet *in* church; they *were* the Church.  

Contrast that with how many of us live today. We’re more connected than ever yet deeply disconnected. We “like” people’s posts but rarely enter their lives. We stream services but rarely share a meal with those we worship with. We crave belonging but resist vulnerability. And yet, this is where God does His best work, where faith meets friendship, and grace gets personal.

Godly friendship isn’t just companionship; it’s spiritual formation. It’s the brother who challenges your thinking when pride creeps in, the sister who prays when words fail, the couple who reminds you to keep loving each other when life wears thin. These relationships aren’t optional; they’re instruments of God’s grace.  

Proverbs 27:17 says, *“As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.”* That sharpening isn’t always comfortable, but it’s essential. Without it, faith dulls. Without it, we lose perspective. Left alone too long, even the strongest believer can drift.  

So if your faith feels stagnant, maybe what’s missing isn’t another devotional or sermon—it’s people. People who walk beside you, not just watch from a distance. People who see the real you and still choose to stay.  

Maybe the next step in deepening your relationship with God isn’t something new to *learn*, but someone new to *walk with.* Invite a friend over for coffee. Join a small group. Text the person who comes to mind when you pray. God often speaks through His people—it’s just that sometimes, we haven’t been listening.  

…just a thought.
