### The Poison We Keep Drinking

No one would willingly drink rat poison.

Not to make a point.  
Not to prove they’re right.  
Not even to hurt someone else.

And yet, emotionally and spiritually, we do something just as irrational all the time.

My wife was listening to a sermon by **[Pastor Vladimir Savchuk](https://pastorvlad.org/)**, and he said something that landed with uncomfortable clarity:  
> *Holding on to bitterness and offense is like drinking rat poison and hoping the other person dies.*

It’s an absurd image.  
And it’s painfully accurate.

### Why We Keep the Cup in Our Hands

Most of us don’t hold onto offense because we enjoy it.  
We hold onto it because we believe it serves us somehow.

We think it preserves justice.  
We think it protects us from being hurt again.  
We think letting go means saying what happened didn’t matter.

So we sip it slowly.

We replay the moment.  
Rehearse the conversation.  
Wait for the other person to feel what we felt.

But the poison doesn’t travel outward.  
It works inward.

### The Quiet Damage of Bitterness

Poison rarely kills instantly.  
It works gradually, quietly, often unnoticed at first.

Bitterness does the same.

It shows up as shortened patience.  
A hardening toward people who had nothing to do with the original wound.  
A dulling of joy that’s hard to explain.  
A heaviness in prayer that feels more like resistance than rest.

You don’t wake up one morning bitter.  
You become bitter by refusing, little by little, to release what you keep consuming.

And the person you’re hoping will be affected often has no idea you’re even hurting.

### From Weight to Toxin

In a previous reflection, I wrote about [The Weight of Offense](https://jeffthomasiii.github.io/Just-a-Thought-Blog/faith/leadership/2025/12/31/The-Weight-of-Offence.html).  
How carrying it exhausts us.  
Distracts us.  
Pulls our attention away from what God is actually doing in front of us.

But weight carried long enough becomes something worse.

It doesn’t just slow you down.  
It changes what’s happening inside you.

What begins as a burden eventually becomes a toxin.

The longer offense is held, the more it reshapes us.  
Not them.  
Us.

### Forgiveness Isn’t Approval

This is where forgiveness is often misunderstood.

Forgiveness doesn’t mean the offense was acceptable.  
It doesn’t minimize harm.  
It doesn’t erase wisdom, boundaries, or truth.

Forgiveness is not denying the poison exists.  
It’s deciding to stop drinking it.

Scripture warns about bitterness taking root not because God is protecting the offender, but because He’s protecting the one carrying it. Roots grow unseen, but they always bear fruit. And not all fruit leads to life.

Letting go is less about releasing someone else and more about reclaiming your own spiritual health.

### Putting the Cup Down

You may never get the apology.  
You may never get the acknowledgment.  
You may never see justice unfold the way you hoped.

But you still get to choose what you carry.

You don’t have to reconcile today.  
You don’t have to confront today.  
You don’t even have to feel resolved today.

But you can decide whether you’ll keep drinking something that’s slowly harming you.

Forgiveness isn’t pretending the poison wasn’t real.  
It’s choosing not to ingest it anymore.

…just a thought.
