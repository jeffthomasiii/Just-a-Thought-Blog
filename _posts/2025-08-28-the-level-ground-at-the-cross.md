Have you ever noticed how quickly favoritism shows up in life?  
On the playground, it’s who gets picked first for the team.  
In the workplace, it’s who gets the promotion everyone else quietly questions.  
Even in families and friendships, favoritism creeps in through small preferences and subtle signals.  

We all know how it feels to be overlooked, and if we’re honest, we know how easy it is to overlook others.  

That’s why the words of Scripture cut so clearly into this human struggle:  
> *“For God shows no partiality.”* (Romans 2:11)  
> *“My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.”* (James 2:1)  

Contextually, Paul’s words in Romans 2 remind us that God’s judgment is not swayed by whether someone is Jew or Gentile, His standard is the same for all. James, writing to scattered believers, warns against giving special treatment to the wealthy while dishonoring the poor in the assembly. Both are addressing different situations, but the principle is consistent: God does not play favorites, and His people are not to either.  

What we can learn from these passages is that partiality, whether based on ethnicity, status, wealth, or appearance, is completely out of step with the character of God. At the foot of the cross, the ground is level. No one stands taller because of privilege or influence. No one sinks lower because of background or mistakes. Christ dismantles our ladders of favoritism and calls us into a unity that reflects His justice and His love.  

#### Favoritism Erodes Love  

Favoritism is subtle but powerful. It whispers, *“This one is worth more, that one less.”* And once whispered, it changes how we act, even if we don’t realize it.  

James paints the picture vividly: a wealthy man enters the gathering and is shown the best seat, while a poor man is told to sit on the floor. It sounds crude, but don’t we often do the same in modern ways? We’re drawn to people who can advance us, affirm us, or make us look good. We hesitate with those who seem needy, different, or difficult.  

But partial love is not God’s love. His love does not shift with status. His mercy is not selective. His heart is not divided.  

#### God’s Impartial Justice  

Paul reminds us in Romans that God’s judgment is impartial. He doesn’t excuse sin because of heritage, culture, or position. Neither does He condemn unfairly. His scales are perfectly balanced, guided by His own holiness.  

That’s not just a theological point; it’s a call to practice justice in daily life.  
- Do we treat coworkers differently based on their role or pay grade?  
- Do we value church members more because of what they contribute financially or socially?  
- Do we make snap judgments based on someone’s appearance or accent?  

God’s impartiality means our worth is not up for human debate. He alone defines it. And He calls His people to reflect that same integrity.  

#### The Level Ground at the Cross  

Perhaps the clearest picture of God’s impartiality is found at the cross.  

Paul wrote in Galatians 3:28 that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Him. That doesn’t erase our differences; it redeems them. God delights in the diversity of His creation, but He refuses to let any difference become a dividing wall.  

At the cross, every barrier loses power. Cultural pride, social hierarchies, personal comparisons, all of them collapse before the glory of Christ. We don’t bring our resumes; our resumes don’t save us. We don’t bring our shame; our shame doesn’t exclude us. We bring ourselves, and we find level ground.  


#### Reflection  

If God has no favorites, why do we?  

It’s worth asking:  
- Who do I unconsciously favor?  
- Who do I quietly overlook?  
- Where am I tempted to build ladders, Christ already tore down?  

Impartial love isn’t easy. It requires us to slow down, to notice the overlooked, to extend kindness without calculation. But when we love this way, we reflect the justice, mercy, and unity of the One who loved us first.  

The cross leaves no room for favoritism. And if we’re His, neither should we.  

…just a thought.  

Where have you seen favoritism cause division, and how might impartial love bring healing instead?
