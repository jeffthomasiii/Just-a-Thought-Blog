title: The Deep Is Where You Grow

It was a quiet conversation, just my wife and I, sharing what we’d been learning in our time with God.  
She shared with a calm, steady conviction, the kind that doesn’t need emphasis or explanation.  
Just truth. Straightforward. Settling.

And somewhere in the middle of her reflection, she said it:  
> _**“On the shore, you’re comfortable. But it’s in the deep where you grow.”**_ - Samatra Thomas

I haven’t been able to shake it since.

### Context & Reflection

The shoreline is beautiful. Predictable. You can feel the sand beneath your feet, hear the rhythm of the waves, and stay grounded.  
It’s steady. Safe. **I like safe.**

That’s probably why what she said struck so deep.  
You see, **I can’t swim**.  
Ask me to sit on the beach? I’m all in.  
Ask me to get on a boat or go on a cruise? I’ll probably hesitate.  
It’s not the water itself I fear, it’s the loss of control.  
I don’t trust the boat not to sink.  
I don’t trust myself not to drown.  
And sometimes… I don’t fully trust God to hold me when I can’t feel the bottom.

That’s the shore for me.  
Comfortable. Manageable.  
But growth? That usually happens **past the point of comfort**.  
It happens when faith looks like a risk.

### Development

Jesus didn’t call Peter to sit on the shore and watch Him perform miracles.  
He called him *out*, into the wind and the waves, into something that made no natural sense (Matthew 14:29).  
Peter stepped not because he trusted the sea, but because he trusted the Savior standing on it.

Throughout Scripture, God calls His people out of safety:

- The Israelites had to step into the Jordan **before** it parted (Joshua 3:15).  
- Abram left his home not knowing where he was going (Hebrews 11:8).  
- The disciples dropped everything to follow Jesus with no roadmap.

In all of these, the invitation wasn’t into comfort. It was into **trust**.  
And trust grows in deep places.

So maybe the real danger isn’t in drowning.  
Maybe it’s in never stepping out.

### Resolution

Here’s the question I’m sitting with:  
**Where have I chosen comfort over growth?**

The shore has its place.  
It’s where we start. It’s where we pause. It’s where we reflect.  
But it’s not where we’re meant to stay.

The deep will stretch you.  
It will challenge everything you think you control.  
It will remind you of your need.  
But it’s also where you’ll see God most clearly.

The deep is where fear meets faith.  
Where surface talk drowns and soul conversations begin.  
Where you're reminded that walking by faith isn’t about swimming, it's about **trusting the One who holds the water**.

**…just a thought.**


What’s the “shore” in your life right now?  
What would it look like to step into the deep, where trust is required and growth begins?
