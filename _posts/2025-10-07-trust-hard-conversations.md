### The Topics We’d Rather Avoid
Every couple has them, the “don’t-go-there” conversations. Money. Intimacy. Family. The ones that feel risky, like one wrong word could tip everything into tension. It feels safer to avoid them, but avoidance doesn’t build trust. It slowly erodes it.  

### Leaning Into What We Fear
I recently came across [an article by Dr. Cortney Warren](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/couples-who-truly-trust-each-other-talk-about-10-things-regularly.html), a Harvard-trained psychologist, that made me pause. She noted that couples who *truly trust* one another lean into the hard conversations. Not because they love conflict, but because trust is built when nothing is off-limits.  Her list included things like money, intimacy, family dynamics, future plans, and more. As I read, it struck me, these aren’t just logistics. They’re windows into our hearts. They reveal priorities, fears, dreams, and vulnerabilities. And when we risk talking about them, even imperfectly, we say to our spouse: *I trust you with all of me.*  Scripture affirms this. *“Whoever gives an honest answer kisses the lips”* (Proverbs 24:26, ESV). Honesty is intimacy. Vulnerability is where trust begins to take root.  

### When Money, Dreams, and Mistakes Become Doorways

Take **money**, for example. Most say it’s the number one source of conflict in marriage. But underneath the numbers are values. Do we see money as security, status, or a tool to bless others? When we talk openly about it, we let our spouse see what truly drives us.  

Or **dreams for the future**. It’s easy to assume we’re on the same page, only to discover years later that our visions diverge. Dreaming out loud, even when those dreams differ, creates unity around an “us” bigger than either “me.”  And then there are 

**past mistakes**. These conversations can feel like walking through a minefield. But handled with humility and grace, they lead to healing. *“Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you”* (Ephesians 4:32, ESV). Facing the past together opens doors for deeper trust.  

### Trust Doesn’t Grow in the Easy Places
The truth is, trust rarely grows in the smooth, agreeable conversations. It grows in the difficult ones—the ones that stretch us to listen longer, forgive quicker, and love deeper. Each time we lean in instead of pulling away, we lay another brick in the covenant foundation of marriage.  So the next time you and your spouse bump into one of those “don’t-go-there” topics, pause. Remember: this isn’t just a fight waiting to happen. It’s a chance for trust to deepen.  

…just a thought.  

Which of these hard conversations do you and your spouse find most challenging, and what might God be inviting you to trust Him with in that area?
