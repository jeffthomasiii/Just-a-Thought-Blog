# You Can’t Love Christ and Hate His Church  
*Because the Bride and the Body Are One.*  
*— just a thought —*

### **When Love and Frustration Collide**

Let’s be honest — the Church can be hard to love sometimes.  
We’ve seen pride where there should’ve been humility, division where there should’ve been unity, and performance where there should’ve been presence. Maybe you’ve said it before: *“I love Jesus, but I don’t like the Church.”*  

I’ve been there too. I’ve been disappointed, disillusioned, even distant. But over time, one truth began to surface again and again:  
> “You can’t love Christ and hate His body.”  

That realization changed how I saw everything. Because as much as I wanted to separate my faith from the Church’s failures, Scripture wouldn’t let me. Christ and His Church are inseparable — the Head and the Body, the Groom and the Bride.

### **The Mystery of Union**

The Church isn’t a human invention; it’s a divine organism — born of Christ, sustained by His Spirit, and united by His love.  

Paul writes:  
- *“Christ is the head of the Church, His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.”* (Ephesians 1:22–23)  
- *“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church and gave Himself up for her.”* (Ephesians 5:25)  
- *“You are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you.”* (1 Corinthians 3:16)  

To love the Head while rejecting the Body isn’t devotion — it’s dismemberment.  
To praise the Groom while despising His Bride is contradiction.  

The Church may be imperfect, but she’s still His. He doesn’t distance Himself from her flaws — He cleanses her through them. What we often call “hypocrisy” or “failure” is sometimes evidence of a body still being healed by grace.

### **When the Body Hurts**

When your body aches, you don’t hate it — you tend to it. You protect it because it’s yours. Christ does the same with His Church.  

He doesn’t abandon her when she falters; He heals her.  
He doesn’t shame her when she’s weak; He strengthens her.  
He doesn’t reject her wounds; He bears them Himself.  

> The Church’s imperfections are not proof of Christ’s absence,  
> but of His ongoing presence and patient work.  

So when we see brokenness in the Church — in leadership, in culture, or in community — the answer isn’t disgust; it’s devotion. The solution isn’t walking away, but walking *with* her toward restoration.  


### **Healthy Love, Honest Tension**

Loving the Church doesn’t mean ignoring her flaws. It means loving her through them, the way Christ does.  

You can be:
- **Disappointed** and still devoted.  
- **Frustrated** yet faithful.  
- **Critical** but constructive.  

You can long for the Church to reflect Christ more clearly without abandoning her altogether. But you cannot hate what He loves.  
Because the moment you do, you’re turning against something that is part of Him.  

> “This is a profound mystery,” Paul says, “but I am talking about Christ and the Church.” (Ephesians 5:32)

That mystery means we don’t get to define the Church by her worst moments, only by His covenant love.


### **Loving What He Loves**

To love Jesus is to love what He loves.  
And He loves His Church, not the version that’s already pure, but the one still being sanctified.  

The Church is the Bride He’s preparing, the Body He’s mending, the Family He’s gathering. She may not yet look radiant, but she will. Every scar she bears is another mark of grace, another place He’s touched and healed.  


### **A Love That Stays**

We live in a culture that walks away easily. But Christ doesn’t.  
He loves with covenant, not convenience.  

Loving the Church means staying when it’s hard, serving when it’s thankless, and praying when it’s painful. It means believing that God’s not done, with her, or with us.  

So yes, you can be disappointed. You can ache for more. You can pray for reform.  
But you can’t claim to love Jesus while hating His Bride.  
You can’t adore the Head while rejecting the Body that bears His name.  

Because when He returns, He’s not coming for scattered believers.  
He’s coming for His Church, washed, restored, radiant in grace.  

And she’s still beautiful in His eyes.  

...Just a thought

Where has frustration with the Church replaced my faithfulness to her?  
And what would it look like for me to love Christ’s Bride the way He does, with patience, hope, and covenant love?
