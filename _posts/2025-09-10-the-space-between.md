I remember standing at the trailhead of a hike, looking at the sign with a glossy photo of the summit view. Blue skies, endless valleys, and the promise of a breathtaking reward. But a couple of hours in, the only view I had was dust, sweat, and a winding path that seemed to climb forever. My legs were sore, my backpack heavy, and I caught myself thinking, *Is this even worth it?*  

That moment, the long stretch between the starting point and the destination, felt like a picture of life with God. We know what’s promised, but the “in-between” is where we actually live most of the time.  

The space between.  
> #### *Grace says the space between is not wasted...it’s where God meets us.*

It’s the place where our best efforts meet our real limitations. Where good intentions collide with weakness. Where we’re not who we once were, but not yet who we long to be. And honestly, that space can feel frustrating.  

But what if it’s also sacred ground?  

When I think about it, the space between trailhead and summit is where the real formation happens. Muscles strengthen. Endurance builds. Perspective shifts. Without the climb, the view wouldn’t mean as much. The same is true spiritually: it’s not just about the destination, but what God is doing in us along the way.  

Scripture reminds us that perfection is Christ’s role: *“the founder and perfecter of our faith”* (Hebrews 12:2). Progress is ours: *“I press on toward the goal”* (Philippians 3:14). And grace is what bridges the space between: *“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing”* (Ephesians 2:8).  

Grace is the bridge over the canyon.  
Grace is the water bottle on the hike.  
Grace is the steady hand that keeps us moving when our strength runs out.  

It reframes the frustration. It reminds us that our unfinished state isn’t evidence of failure but proof of God’s ongoing work.  

So when marriage feels like two hikers stumbling up the same mountain at different paces… grace.  
When work feels like scaffolding everywhere and no finish line in sight… grace.  
When spiritual growth feels slower than it “should” be… grace.  

Grace is the gift that says the space between is not wasted. It’s where God meets us, sustains us, and forms us.  

One day, the summit will come. The scaffolding will come down. The view will open wide. But until then, we keep walking, imperfect, but not abandoned. Pressing on but carried by grace.  

The space between is not failure. It’s formation. And it’s where we learn to trust the One who already finished the climb for us.  

…just a thought.
