Sometimes peace isn’t handed to you, you have to fight for it, not with your fists, but with your focus.
Camping has become part of our monthly rhythm, a time to step away from the constant noise and reconnect. But in July, work travel and a full calendar kept us from getting out, so by August we were more than ready for a reset.
We didn’t go far, just about 45 minutes from home, but the point wasn’t the distance. It was about making space to refocus, recalibrate, and rest. The day we arrived was 102°, so we stayed cool in the trailer until the evening promised relief. That’s when we noticed it: water pooling inside one of the ceiling light fixtures.
If you know RVs, you know water intrusion is about the last thing you want to see. In that moment, we had a decision to make, pack it up and head home, or deal with the problem and still enjoy our trip.
We chose the latter.
That choice wasn’t about ignoring reality. We addressed the leak carefully, but we also knew if we let it, the frustration could hijack our whole weekend.
Isaiah 26:3 says God keeps in *perfect peace* the one whose mind is stayed on Him because they trust Him. Perfect peace isn’t the absence of trouble, it’s the presence of trust. It’s not found by accident; it’s found on purpose.
Pressing on toward peace means deciding where your attention will rest. We could have stared at the problem all weekend or fixed it and returned our focus to why we came: to be still, to be together, and to rest in the One who gives peace no storm can steal.
That night, under a cooler sky, I thought about how often life gives us the same choice: let the interruptions win or keep our minds fixed on the One who holds us steady.
The truth is, peace is something we protect by choosing it over and over again, even when the conditions aren’t perfect. Especially when they aren’t perfect.

…just a thought.
