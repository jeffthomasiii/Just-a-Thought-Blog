What does it mean to wrestle with God?  

Jacob’s story gives us a picture. A night beside the river. Everything he owned, everyone he loved, sent ahead. Nothing left but fear, memory, and the weight of tomorrow.  

He was preparing to face Esau. But what he faced that night wasn’t his brother. It was God.  

They wrestled until dawn. Flesh against flesh. Will against will. And when it ended, Jacob walked away with a limp… and a new name.  

But I can’t help wondering: was that limp a wound? Or was it a gift?  


### Stripped in the Struggle  

The story starts with Jacob alone. No family to shield him. No possessions to hide behind. No schemes left to play.  

And I wonder if that’s often where God meets us too, not in the noise of control, but in the silence of being stripped bare.  

“What is your name?” the man asked. Jacob had to answer. He had to speak the truth: deceiver. Heel-grabber. The one who had spent his life striving, taking, running.  

Is that part of wrestling with God? Facing who we really are when there’s nowhere left to hide?  


### Broken for Blessing  

Then came the touch. Just one touch—and Jacob’s hip gave way. His strength was no match.  

But notice what happened next: Jacob didn’t let go. He clung tighter. “I will not let You go unless You bless me.”  

Was that desperation? Surrender? Both?  

It strikes me that Jacob wasn’t the one in control anymore. He wasn’t stealing blessing like before. He was holding on, empty-handed, waiting to receive.  

And he did receive. A new name: Israel. A new identity, carried forward with every step… and with every limp.  


### Our Wrestle With God  

We don’t fight God beside a river. But maybe we know something of the struggle.  

The long nights of prayer that feel like silence.  
The questions that won’t resolve.  
The fears that shadow tomorrow.  

Maybe wrestling with God today looks like naming what we’d rather avoid.  
Maybe it’s holding on when we’ve lost all strength.  
Maybe it’s walking forward with the limp He leaves behind—reminders of encounters too deep to explain.  

I wonder: what limps do we carry? Loss? Regret? Weakness we wish we could shake?  

And could it be that those very marks aren’t curses, but signs we’ve been with Him?  


### Clinging Through the Limp  

Faith rarely looks neat. Sometimes it’s sweat and struggle. Sometimes it’s refusing to let go, even when our prayers feel unanswered and our hearts feel worn thin.  

But maybe that’s the point. God doesn’t wrestle us to destroy us. He wrestles us to change us. To name us. To leave us walking differently than before.  

So I find myself asking: what if the limp isn’t the evidence of defeat… but of encounter?  


What does wrestling with God mean for you?  
And if you walk with a limp, is it a wound… or is it a blessing?  

…just a thought.
