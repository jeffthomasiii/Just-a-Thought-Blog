On our morning walk today, Samatra said something that stopped me mid-step.

> *“I’m no longer going to carry the weight of being offended by other people’s behavior.”*

It was simple. Calm. Settled. And it lingered with me long after we got home.

Most of us don’t think of offense as something we carry. We think of it as something that happens to us. Someone says the wrong thing. Someone acts poorly. Someone crosses a line. And suddenly offense feels automatic, even responsible. As if noticing it requires us to hold onto it.

> But offense is not neutral. It always comes with weight.

We often justify that weight by pointing to the behavior that caused it. And sometimes the behavior really is wrong. Hurt is real. Disrespect is real. But offense quietly shifts the focus. It turns from what happened into what we now carry.

And carrying it has side effects.

Offense drains emotional energy. It occupies mental space. It reshapes conversations and prayers. It keeps us tied to moments and people who may not even remember the interaction. What begins as awareness slowly becomes burden.

Scripture recognizes this distinction. Hebrews speaks of laying aside not only sin, but weight. Things that are not always sinful, but still slow us down. Offense fits that category well. It feels justified, but it makes progress harder. It makes peace heavier.

Proverbs says it is a person’s glory to overlook an offense. Not because the offense was imaginary, but because wisdom knows what is not worth carrying. Overlooking is not weakness. It is discernment. It is strength under control.

Jesus spoke often about burdens. Heavy ones. Crushing ones. The kind people were never meant to bear. And His invitation was never to deny reality, but to exchange weight. To bring what exhausts us and receive rest instead.

Offense promises control, but it often delivers captivity. We replay words. We rehearse responses. We relive moments. And all the while, the weight remains with us, not them.

That’s why Samatra’s words mattered so much to me. She didn’t say the behavior didn’t matter. She didn’t say it didn’t hurt. She simply refused to keep paying the cost.

“I’m no longer going to carry the weight.”

That is not avoidance. That is freedom.

Maybe the question is not whether we have a right to be offended. Maybe the better question is whether this weight is worth carrying at all.

…just a thought.
