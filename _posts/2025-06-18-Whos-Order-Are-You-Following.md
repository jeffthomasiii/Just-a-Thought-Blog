We live in a world where “good people” will drop everything for a friend, stay late at work without hesitation, and serve at church every Sunday, but haven’t had an uninterrupted dinner with their spouse or children in months. 

It’s not a time problem. It’s an order problem.

## When Good Gets Out of Order

The culture around us constantly teaches us to value what’s visible, measurable, and applauded. Careers. Friendships. Causes. Appearances. Even service. But many believers find themselves exhausted, fragmented, and wondering why something still feels “off” spiritually or emotionally.

Often, the issue isn't what we’re doing, it’s **the order in which we’re doing it.**

God designed a relational order that’s not arbitrary, it’s protective. It honors covenant. It nurtures wholeness. It reflects His own character. But when we let the world determine our priorities, we risk placing even good things out of alignment with His best.

## God’s Order vs The World’s Way

Here’s a comparison worth sitting with:

### The World’s Priority Pattern
1. **Work** – Identity, success, hustle.
2. **Friends** – Loyalty, social fulfillment.
3. **Children** – Center of the home.
4. **Spouse** – When convenient.
5. **God** – Sunday mornings, maybe.
6. **Extended Family** – As needed.
7. **Believers** – Loose connection.
8. **Non-believers** – Causes, culture.
9. **Strangers** – Performative kindness.

### God’s Priority Pattern
1. **God** – Our source, not just a slot in the schedule.  
   _“But seek first the kingdom of God…”_ (Matt. 6:33)  
2. **Spouse** – A covenant before children came.  
   _“…and the two shall become one flesh.”_ (Gen. 2:24)  
3. **Children** – A blessing, not the center.  
   _“Bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.”_ (Eph. 6:4)  
4. **Family (Extended)** – Honor, not enable.  
   _“Honor your father and your mother…”_ (Ex. 20:12)  
5. **Friends** – A gift, not a guide.  
   _“A friend loves at all times…”_ (Prov. 17:17)  
6. **Work** – Provision, not identity.  
   _“Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord…”_ (Col. 3:23)  
7. **Believers** – Spiritual family.  
   _“…especially to those who are of the household of faith.”_ (Gal. 6:10)  
8. **Non-believers** – Missional compassion, not conformity.  
   _“Go therefore and make disciples…”_ (Matt. 28:19)  
9. **Strangers/Others** – Kindness rooted in Christ.  
   _“Do not neglect to show hospitality…”_ (Heb. 13:2)

## Where We Get It Twisted

When kids become the center of the home instead of the fruit of a strong marriage, we risk building our identity around parenting rather than partnership.

When work becomes the primary place we feel useful or valuable, we may unintentionally neglect the relationships that matter more eternally.

When our phones and social circles become more nourishing than prayer or Scripture, it’s no wonder we feel spiritually dry even in busy seasons.

Most believers wouldn’t say they’ve rejected God’s order, but many of us have **drifted** from it. Not out of rebellion, but out of routine.

That’s the danger. Drift is subtle. But so is re-alignment.

## A Question of Alignment

What does your calendar say about your priorities?  
What about your bank statement?  
What about your mental energy? Your prayer life?

God’s order isn’t about legalism or guilt, it’s about *freedom*. His design leads to peace. His order helps us love well without being overwhelmed.

We can’t give what we don’t have. And we can’t keep giving to everyone else while starving the very relationships God holds most sacred.

Start by asking:
- Where am I over-investing that God asked me to trust Him?
- Where am I under-investing that God has called me to nurture?
- What one change this week would bring my heart closer to His order?

Realignment doesn’t require a massive overhaul. Just obedience, one choice at a time.

…just a thought.
