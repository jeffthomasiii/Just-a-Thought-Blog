excerpt: "What if imposter syndrome isn’t evidence that you don’t belong, but a sign that you’re standing somewhere new?"

There’s a particular kind of discomfort that shows up when responsibility arrives before confidence feels settled.  
Not panic. Not failure. Just the persistent sense that you don’t quite belong yet.

I’ve noticed that this tension often appears not when we’re failing, but when we’re being trusted. And that has made me wonder whether imposter syndrome is less a sign of incapability and more a posture of growth.

Imposter syndrome is usually described as a fear of being exposed. As if at any moment someone will realize you don’t deserve the seat you’re in. That you’re underqualified. Unprepared. Out of place. We tend to treat that feeling as evidence, proof that something is wrong with us.

But what if that interpretation is off?

> What if the feeling we translate as *“I can’t do this”* is actually closer to *“I haven’t done this before”*?

Psychology and neuroscience offer an interesting lens here. When we step into unfamiliar territory, the brain doesn’t calmly evaluate our competence. It reacts to novelty. New environments, new expectations, new relational dynamics all register as uncertainty. And uncertainty triggers the same internal alarms as threat. The brain’s fear response doesn’t distinguish well between incapability and inexperience. They produce the same signal. The same tension. The same instinct to withdraw.

The fear isn’t imaginary, but it may be misunderstood.

That helps explain why imposter syndrome often shows up when the work actually matters. When decisions carry weight. When people are watching. When responsibility is entrusted before it feels internalized. The discomfort isn’t random. It tends to surface right at the edge of growth.

I’ve also noticed that this feeling rarely appears when we’re indifferent. It shows up when we care. When we want to steward responsibility well. When we’re aware of complexity instead of naive to it. In that sense, imposter syndrome may say less about incompetence and more about conscience.

Leadership has a way of exposing this quickly. The shift from observing to owning. From offering opinions to bearing responsibility. From silence being safe to silence being costly. It’s easy to confuse unfamiliar authority with unworthiness. But those are not the same thing.

Over time, something shifts. Repetition softens the fear. Experience replaces novelty. What once felt like disqualification slowly becomes fluency. The room doesn’t change, but we do. The tension fades not because we were exposed as frauds, but because we were never frauds to begin with. We were learners standing on unfamiliar ground.

> So maybe imposter syndrome isn’t always a warning sign.  
Maybe it’s a signal.

Not to retreat, but to pay attention. To recognize that growth often feels like trespassing until it becomes inhabiting.

Perhaps the better question isn’t, *“Do I belong here?”*  
But, *“What is this place forming in me?”*

…just a thought.
