They show up quietly, through insecurity, exhaustion, discouragement, or a sudden heaviness that settles into your wife’s or your child’s heart. Not as a crisis you can point to, but as a weight you can feel. The room feels different. The tone shifts. You can tell something is being carried.

In one version of the moment, you notice it and don’t feel rushed or threatened by it. You’re not perfectly composed, but you’re present. You listen before you speak. You don’t rush to solve what doesn’t need solving. Words come slowly, but they’re steady. You’re able to remind her of what’s true without dismissing what hurts. Sometimes you pray out loud. Sometimes you just stay close. The situation itself doesn’t instantly change, but the space between you does. The weight doesn’t feel as lonely anymore.

In another version of the same moment, everything on the outside looks almost identical. Same day. Same tiredness. Same quiet heaviness. But this time, you feel irritated before you understand why. The moment feels inconvenient. You respond quickly, but not carefully. Maybe with frustration. Maybe with silence. Maybe with a tone that lands harder than you meant it to. You walk away knowing you didn’t show up the way you wanted to.

Later, when things are quiet again, the reflection comes. You replay the exchange. You pray. You feel the gap between who you want to be and how you responded. Not because you don’t love her, but because you weren’t prepared for a battle that didn’t announce itself.

I’ve noticed this pattern not just in theory, but in my own life. In moments with my wife. With my daughter. With other family members or friends. When I’ve been faithful with my own spiritual maintenance, even in small, ordinary ways, wisdom tends to show up when it’s needed. Patience follows. Words come with restraint and life. And when I haven’t been, they don’t. I find myself short, distracted, or internally overwhelmed, and later bringing that back to God in prayer, wishing I had been more present, more grounded, steadier.

Scripture speaks about standing firm when the day of difficulty comes, not scrambling to prepare once it’s already here (Ephesians 6:13, ESV). That idea has stayed with me. Not as pressure, but as clarity. These moments don’t wait for us to feel ready.

The difference in those moments hasn’t been love or intention. It’s been preparation.

Spiritual battles don’t schedule themselves. They don’t pause while we gather ourselves. And often, there isn’t time in the moment to go find strength we haven’t been tending to beforehand.

Love prepares. Not because we expect something to go wrong, but because the people entrusted to us deserve someone who can stand firm when quiet battles show up at the door.

…just a thought.
