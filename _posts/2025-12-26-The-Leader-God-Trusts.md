Most people want influence. Fewer people want the formation that makes influence safe.

We often imagine leadership trust as something God gives suddenly, in big moments, with visible platforms and clear authority. But Scripture tells a quieter story. God entrusts leadership slowly. Carefully. Purposefully. And almost always out of sight.

> “The one who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much...” Luke 16:10

God does not start by asking whether we are impressive. He asks whether we are trustworthy. He watches how we handle small responsibilities, unseen moments, quiet obedience, and inconvenient faithfulness. Long before there is a platform, there is a pattern.

The leaders God trusts are not perfect. They are consistent.  
They show up when no one is watching.  
They obey even when it costs them something.  
They steward what they have instead of resenting what they do not.  

David was trusted with sheep before he was trusted with a kingdom. Joseph was faithful in prison before he was faithful in a palace. Moses tended flocks before he led a nation. Jesus Himself spent decades in obscurity before stepping into public ministry.

God does not rush formation.

Trust is built in the ordinary. In daily choices. In private integrity. In how we speak when no one is listening. In how we lead when recognition is absent. In how we treat people who cannot advance us.

This is where many leaders grow impatient. We want more responsibility without deeper refinement. More influence without greater surrender. More authority without the weight of accountability. But God forms leaders who can carry influence without being consumed by it.

A leader God trusts is not driven by applause.  
They are anchored in obedience.  
They are not shaped by comparison.  
They are shaped by conviction.  

Faithfulness is not glamorous, but it is powerful. It builds a foundation God can safely build upon. It creates leaders who remain steady when pressure comes and humble when success arrives.

So if leadership feels slow, unseen, or heavy, it may not be punishment. It may be preparation. God may be forming something in you that cannot be rushed.

The goal of leadership is not to be noticed.  
It is to be trusted.  

And when God trusts a leader, He knows their influence will point back to Him.

…just a thought.
