There is a difference between a good idea, and a God shaped vision. Ideas come quickly. Ideas spark excitement. Ideas rise in moments of clarity and fall in moments of pressure. But vision, real vision, the kind that endures storms and seasons, does not come from our ambition. It comes from God.

Leaders often feel pressure to create vision. Define the plan. Chart the future. Paint the picture. And while planning has its place, Scripture never treats vision as something we invent. It treats vision as something we receive.

“Where there is no revelation, people cast off restraint...” Proverbs 29

Vision is not about goals. Vision is about hearing from God. It is about seeing what He sees and aligning your life, your leadership, and your decisions with His direction. Vision does not start with strategy. It starts with surrender.

This is why some visions fade and others endure. When a vision is built on personal ambition, it collapses under pressure. When it is rooted in emotion, it disappears when circumstances change. When it is built on preference, it shifts every time our desires shift. But when vision is born from the heart of God, it lasts far beyond the leader who carries it.

God shaped vision has weight. It has clarity. It has staying power. It stands firm in discouragement, in delay, and even in opposition. It does not disappear when the results are slow or when the path is difficult. It endures because the One who gave it endures.

Think of the visions God entrusted throughout Scripture.  
Noah, build the ark.  
Abraham, look at the stars.  
Moses, deliver my people.  
Nehemiah, rebuild the wall.  
Paul, carry the gospel to the nations.

None of these visions were crafted in a strategy meeting or pulled from personal inspiration. They were the overflow of revelation. God spoke. God guided. God sustained.

And the vision lasted because God did.

As leaders, we can confuse activity with clarity. We can rush into planning before we pause to listen. We can run ahead of God while asking Him to bless what we already decided. But lasting vision is not discovered by running faster. It is discovered by drawing nearer.

So, ask yourself.  
Is my vision something I created or something I received.  
Did it come from my desire or from time in God’s presence.  
Is it built on emotion or on conviction.  
Is it shaped by culture or shaped by Scripture.

When vision comes from God, you do not have to force it. You do not have to hype it. You do not have to carry it alone. You simply walk in obedience and trust the One who sees the road you cannot.

Vision that lasts does not begin with you.  
It begins with God.  
And when it begins with God, it can outlast you.

…just a thought.
