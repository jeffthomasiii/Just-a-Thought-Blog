It’s easy to measure success by tasks completed, goals achieved, or projects finished. But life has a way of reminding us that people matter more than projects.  

I once knew a man who could fix anything with his hands but struggled to connect with those around him. His house was immaculate, his work meticulous, but his relationships were strained. The problem wasn’t competence, it was connection.  

Interpersonal skills are often dismissed as “soft skills,” but they are anything but soft. They’re the glue that holds marriages, friendships, workplaces, and communities together. Listening with empathy. Asking thoughtful questions. Offering encouragement instead of criticism. These are the small acts that build trust.  

Scripture points us here too: *“Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.”* (Ephesians 4:2–3 NIV). Relationships thrive not on perfection, but on patience, humility, and grace.  

But our culture doesn’t make this easy. Hustle culture celebrates busyness as if it were a badge of honor. We admire the man who stays late, finishes the project, and squeezes more productivity out of his week. Yet all too often, the cost is unseen, the family waiting at home, the friendships slowly fading, the soul that grows weary. Busyness tricks us into thinking efficiency is more valuable than presence. But presence is what people long for most.  

Think about it:  
- A boss can set deadlines, but if he can’t listen to his team, resentment builds.  
- A husband can provide financially, but if he never speaks words of kindness, his home will feel cold.  
- A friend can offer advice, but if he doesn’t listen first, his words will feel empty.  

Culturally, we reward accomplishment. But relationships don’t measure themselves in checklists, they measure in presence, compassion, and consistency.  

A man who prioritizes people over projects communicates something profound: “You matter more than what I can get done.” That kind of man is remembered not for what he built, but for who he built up.  

Because in the end, people forget most of our projects, but they never forget how we treated them.  

…just a thought.
