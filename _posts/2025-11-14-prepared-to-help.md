Crisis rarely announces itself. It shows up in the middle of dinner when a child starts choking, on the side of the road after an accident, or in a storm when the power goes out and cell service fails. In those moments, the difference between panic and peace is often preparation.  

A man doesn’t need to be a doctor or a soldier to make a difference. But every man should know the basics: how to stop a bleed, how to perform CPR, how to use a radio when phones don’t work, how to calm a voice over the airwaves until help arrives. These aren’t glamorous skills, but they are lifesaving ones.  

I remember hearing about a family whose vacation nearly turned tragic when their young son slipped underwater. His father pulled him out, but froze, he didn’t know CPR. Thankfully, a bystander stepped in and saved the boy’s life. The father’s strength pulled him out of the water, but someone else’s preparedness brought him back. That moment changed him. He later said, “Never again. I’ll be ready next time.”  

Proverbs 22:3 NIV says, *“The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.”* Wisdom doesn’t eliminate danger, it prepares us to face it with steadiness.  

But our culture doesn’t encourage preparedness. We live in an age where help is always a phone call away, where convenience cushions almost every risk. We assume emergencies are someone else’s job to solve. Yet when the unexpected happens, comfort can’t save us, only competence can. The men who stand steady in those moments are the ones who prepared before the crisis came.  

Preparedness is an act of love.  
- It says, “I care enough to be ready.”  
- It means your presence brings calm instead of fear.  
- It equips you to serve others instead of standing helpless.  

Medical, first aid, and communications basics won’t make headlines. But they can mean everything in a moment that matters.  

Because a man who is prepared to help can turn fear into hope when it’s needed most.  

…just a thought.
