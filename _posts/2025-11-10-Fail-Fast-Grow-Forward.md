You can tell a lot about a person by how long they stare at their mistakes. Some replay them like a bad highlight reel—pausing, rewinding, analyzing every angle, while others take a breath, jot down what they learned, and move on.  

Our Chief of Staff said something recently that stuck with me:  
> “Where we fail, which is a part of the game, we fail fast and move on to the next one.”  

That line caught me because it reframed failure. Not as a stop sign, but as part of the process. In life, leadership, and even faith, failure isn’t an interruption to progress, it *is* progress, just dressed in humility.  


### **Reframing Failure**
We’ve been conditioned to fear failure as if it defines us. But what if failure simply *refines* us?  
Every skill worth having, leadership, communication, patience, even faith, grows through trial and error. Upskilling isn’t just about acquiring knowledge; it’s about learning how to recover from what doesn’t work.  

“Fail fast” doesn’t mean skipping reflection, it means not *dwelling* in regret. It’s the difference between a lesson learned and a label worn.  


### **Faith and the Fast Fail**
The Bible doesn’t hide failure, it highlights it. Peter denied Jesus three times and was still called to lead the church. Moses struck the rock in anger and still made it into the hall of faith. Paul started his ministry with a public disagreement that split his team, yet God still used him to write half the New Testament.  

Their failures didn’t end their calling; they shaped it.  

Proverbs 24:16 reminds us, *“The righteous falls seven times and rises again.”*  
The difference between the righteous and the rest isn’t that they never fall, it’s that they get back up faster.  


### **Failing Forward**
In leadership, “fail fast” is an innovation mindset: test, learn, adapt, repeat. In faith, it’s called repentance, acknowledging what went wrong and stepping forward in grace.  

Both depend on humility. Both require the courage to keep going.  

The real danger isn’t failure, it’s *fear of failure.* That fear keeps us from experimenting, from speaking up, from trying new ideas. But when failure becomes normal, learning becomes natural.  

You can’t grow without falling, and you can’t fall without risk. Growth, real growth, comes from those small, honest failures we choose to face, learn from, and move through.  


### **Closing Reflection**
Maybe the goal isn’t to avoid failure, but to *master recovery.*  
To fail fast is to learn fast, to recognize what isn’t working, take the lesson, and move forward in faith.  

Because God doesn’t expect perfection, He builds perseverance.  

So the next time you stumble, remember failure isn’t falling down. It’s staying down.  
Get up. Learn. Try again.  

…just a thought.  

What’s one failure that taught you something essential about growth or grace?
