I recently heard one of my blog posts read back to me, not by a friend, not by a narrator, but by two AI hosts having a conversation *about* it.

There was something both surreal and strangely insightful about hearing my own words interpreted, discussed, and responded to… like my blog had come alive.

This was my first experiment with [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google), and it didn’t disappoint.

### What Sparked This?

I’ve always been hands-on when it comes to technology. My learning style doesn’t lean theoretical, I have to *try it* to understand it.

NotebookLM released a feature that turns your uploaded documents into podcast-style conversations. Naturally, I dropped in a few recent blog posts to see what it would generate.

I didn’t tweak any settings. No tone changes. No host selections. I just uploaded, clicked “generate,” and listened.

What came back wasn’t flawless, some points were interpreted differently than I’d intended. But that was kind of the beauty of it. My blog has never been about giving answers. It’s about sparking thoughtful dialogue. And this time, that conversation came from an unexpected place: an AI voice.

### What Is NotebookLM?

[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google) is a research assistant built by Google. It lets you upload content (blog posts, PDFs, notes, etc.) and ask questions, summarize, or, my favorite, create a podcast-style episode.

The podcast mode features two AI hosts discussing your content, pulling out themes, and even raising questions. It’s not just reading aloud, it’s interpretive, which made for an interesting experience.

I created three “episodes,” each based on my own blog posts:

#### 🎙️ Between Pines and Shorelines: Why We Camp

A reflection on how camping became a way for my wife and me to reconnect, spiritually, emotionally, and relationally. More than a weekend getaway, it’s become a rhythm of retreat.

#### 🎙️ Thinking Out Loud: The Discipline of Reflection

This post explains why I blog at all. For me, blogging is not about broadcasting; it’s about processing. Reflection is a spiritual discipline, and writing helps me pause and listen more clearly to what God might be showing me.

#### 🎙️ Speak Life Over Them: Marital Prayer and Scripture Guidance


This one’s a three-part series exploring the power of speaking life into your spouse through prayer and Scripture. It’s not just encouragement, it’s equipping. Each post focuses on a different voice:

### What Did I Learn?


It’s easy to think your words are clear, until you hear them interpreted back to you.

Some nuances were missed. Some points were flattened or reshaped. But I gained something valuable in the process: a new perspective on how my writing might be received by others.

It reminded me of what authors often feel when they get feedback from beta readers. You don’t write to be misunderstood, but if you are, the right response isn’t defensiveness. It’s reflection. Growth. Refinement.

Will I create a full podcast? Maybe. Maybe not. The inspiration is there, but so are the practical limitations of time and margin. For now, I’ll keep experimenting. I’ll keep reflecting. And I’ll keep writing.


…just a thought.
