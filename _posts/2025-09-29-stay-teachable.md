I once heard someone say, “The moment you think you’ve arrived is the moment you stop growing.” That line has stayed with me, because it names a quiet temptation in every man: to assume we’ve learned enough, done enough, and figured out enough to coast.  

I remember watching two men approach the same problem very differently. One was a seasoned tradesman asked to learn a new digital tool for his work. He laughed it off, saying, “That’s for the younger guys, I’ve been doing this long enough, I don’t need it.” The other man, only a few years younger, leaned in. He asked questions, took notes, and wrestled with it until he got it. A year later, the first man was struggling to stay relevant in his field, while the second had become the go-to mentor for others.  

The difference wasn’t intelligence. It was posture. One had closed the door to growth. The other had left it open.  

Teachability is not weakness; it’s humility. It’s the courage to admit you don’t have all the answers, and the openness to keep learning. Proverbs says, *“Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance.”* (Proverbs 1:5) Wisdom is not about hoarding knowledge, it’s about staying open to correction and growth.  

I’ve seen teachability in older men who still ask questions, who are curious about new tools, who invite feedback without bristling. And I’ve seen its absence in men much younger—those who shrug off advice because they think they know better. One posture leads to growth: the other leads to stagnation.  

Being teachable doesn’t just shape us intellectually. It forms us relationally and spiritually.  
- **Relationally,** it means we listen to our wives, our children, our friends, without dismissing their perspective.  
- **Spiritually,** it means we remain open to God’s Word and Spirit correcting us, even in areas we thought we had figured out.  

It’s a posture of humility and curiosity that keeps us pliable in God’s hands.  

A teachable man doesn’t have to know everything, he just has to keep learning. And that posture of growth is often the very thing that makes him trustworthy.  

Staying teachable is not about arriving. It’s about remaining open. Open to God, open to wisdom, open to people who sharpen us.  

Because a man who keeps learning will never stop growing.  

…just a thought.
